in this example the data of file is transcluded into the document in computer science transclusion is the inclusion of part or all of an electronic document into one or more other documents by hypertext reference transclusion is usually performed when the referencing document is displayed and is normally automatic and transparent to the end user the result of transclusion is single integrated document made of parts assembled dynamically from separate sources possibly stored on different computers in disparate places transclusion facilitates modular design resource is stored once and distributed for reuse in multiple documents updates or corrections to resource are then reflected in any referencing documents ted nelson coined the term for his 1980 nonlinear book literary machines but the idea of master copy and occurrences was applied 17 years before in sketchpad contents 1 technical considerations 1 1 context neutrality 1 2 parameterization 2 origins 3 history and implementation by project xanadu 4 implementation on the web 4 1 client side html 4 2 server side transclusion 4 3 transclusion of source code 5 see also 6 references 7 further reading 8 external links technical considerations context neutrality transclusion works better when transcluded sections of text are self contained so that the meaning and validity of the text is independent of context for example formulations like as explained in the previous section are problematic because the transcluded section may appear in different context causing confusion what constitutes context neutral text varies but often includes things like company information or boilerplate parameterization under some circumstances and in some technical contexts transcluded sections of text may not require strict adherence to the context neutrality principle because the transcluded sections are capable of parameterization parameterization implies the ability to modify certain portions or subsections of transcluded text depending on exogenous variables that can be changed independently this is customarily done by supplying transcluded text with one or more substitution placeholders these placeholders are then replaced with the corresponding variable values prior to rendering the final transcluded output in context origins the concept of reusing file content began with computer programming languages cobol in 1960 followed by bcpl pl c and by the 1990s even fortran an include directive allows common source code to be reused while avoiding the pitfalls of copy and paste programming and hard coding of constants as with many innovations problem developed multiple include directives may provide the

critiques of autonomous models of literacy notwithstanding the belief that reading development is key to literacy remains dominant at least in the united states where it is understood as progression of skills that begins with the ability to understand spoken words and decode written words and that culminates in the deep understanding of text reading development involves range of complex language underpinnings including awareness of speech sounds phonology spelling patterns orthography word meaning semantics grammar syntax and patterns of word formation morphology all of which provide necessary platform for reading fluency and comprehension once these skills are acquired it is maintained reader can attain full language literacy which includes the abilities to apply to printed material critical analysis inference and synthesis to write with accuracy and coherence and to use information and insights from text as the basis for informed decisions and creative thought for this reason teaching english literacy in the united states is dominated by focus on set of discrete decoding skills from this perspective literacy or rather reading comprises number of subskills that can be taught to students these skill sets include phonological awareness phonics decoding fluency comprehension and vocabulary mastering each of these subskills is necessary for students to become proficient readers from this same perspective readers of alphabetic languages must understand the alphabetic principle to master basic reading skills for this purpose writing system is alphabetic if it uses symbols to represent individual language sounds though the degree of correspondence between letters and sounds varies between alphabetic languages syllabic writing systems such as japanese kana use symbol to represent single syllable and logographic writing systems such as chinese use symbol to represent morpheme there are any number of approaches to teaching literacy each is shaped by its informing assumptions about what literacy is and how it is best learned by students phonics instruction for example focuses on reading at the level of the word it teaches readers to observe and interpret the letters or groups of letters that make up words common method of teaching phonics is synthetic phonics in which novice reader pronounces each individual sound and blends them to pronounce the whole word another approach is embedded phonics instruction used more often in whole language reading instruction in which novice readers learn about the individual letters in words on just in time just in place basis that is tailored to meet each student

critiques of autonomous models of literacy notwithstanding the belief that reading development is key to literacy remains dominant at least in the united states where it is understood as progression of skills that begins with the ability to understand spoken words and decode written words and that culminates in the deep understanding of text reading development involves range of complex language underpinnings including awareness of speech sounds phonology spelling patterns orthography word meaning semantics grammar syntax and patterns of word formation morphology all of which provide necessary platform for reading fluency and comprehension once these skills are acquired it is maintained reader can attain full language literacy which includes the abilities to apply to printed material critical analysis inference and synthesis to write with accuracy and coherence and to use information and insights from text as the basis for informed decisions and creative thought for this reason teaching english literacy in the united states is dominated by focus on set of discrete decoding skills from this perspective literacy or rather reading comprises number of subskills that can be taught to students these skill sets include phonological awareness phonics decoding fluency comprehension and vocabulary mastering each of these subskills is necessary for students to become proficient readers from this same perspective readers of alphabetic languages must understand the alphabetic principle to master basic reading skills for this purpose writing system is alphabetic if it uses symbols to represent individual language sounds though the degree of correspondence between letters and sounds varies between alphabetic languages syllabic writing systems such as japanese kana use symbol to represent single syllable and logographic writing systems such as chinese use symbol to represent morpheme there are any number of approaches to teaching literacy each is shaped by its informing assumptions about what literacy is and how it is best learned by students phonics instruction for example focuses on reading at the level of the word it teaches readers to observe and interpret the letters or groups of letters that make up words common method of teaching phonics is synthetic phonics in which novice reader pronounces each individual sound and blends them to pronounce the whole word another approach is embedded phonics instruction used more often in whole language reading instruction in which novice readers learn about the individual letters in words on just in time just in place basis that is tailored to meet each student

product backlog the product backlog is breakdown of work to be done and contains an ordered list of product requirements that scrum team maintains for product common formats include user stories and use cases the requirements define features bug fixes non functional requirements etc whatever must be done to deliver viable product the product owner prioritizes product backlog items pbis based on considerations such as risk business value dependencies size and date needed the product backlog is what will be delivered ordered into the sequence in which it should be delivered it is visible to everyone but may only be changed with the consent of the product owner who is ultimately responsible for ordering product backlog items for the development team to choose the product backlog contains the product owner assessment of business value and the development team assessment of development effort which are often but not always stated in story points using the rounded fibonacci scale these estimates help the product owner to gauge the timeline and may influence the ordering of product backlog items for example if two features have the same business value the product owner may schedule earlier delivery of the one with the lower development effort because the return on investment is higher or the one with higher development effort because it is more complex or riskier and they want to retire that risk earlier the product backlog and the business value of each product backlog item is the responsibility of the product owner the effort to deliver each item is estimated by the development team in story points or time by estimating in story points the team reduces the dependency in individual developers this is useful especially in dynamic teams where developers are often assigned to other projects after sprint delivery for instance if user story is estimated as 5 in effort using fibonacci sequence it remains 5 regardless of how many developers are working on it story points define the effort in time box so they do not change with time for instance in one hour an individual can walk run or climb but the effort expended is clearly different the gap progression between the terms in the fibonacci sequence encourages the team to deliver carefully considered estimates estimates of 1 2 or 3 imply similar efforts 1 being trivial but if the team estimates an 8 or 13 or higher the impact

ward cunningham inventor of the wiki ward cunningham and co author bo leuf in their book the wiki way quick collaboration on the web described the essence of the wiki concept as follows wiki invites all users not just experts to edit any page or to create new pages within the wiki web site using only standard plain vanilla web browser without any extra add ons wiki promotes meaningful topic associations between different pages by making page link creation intuitively easy and showing whether an intended target page exists or not wiki is not carefully crafted site created by experts and professional writers and designed for casual visitors instead it seeks to involve the typical visitor user in an ongoing process of creation and collaboration that constantly changes the website landscape wiki enables communities of editors and contributors to write documents collaboratively all that people require to contribute is computer internet access web browser and basic understanding of simple markup language g mediawiki markup language single page in wiki website is referred to as wiki page while the entire collection of pages which are usually well interconnected by hyperlinks is the wiki wiki is essentially database for creating browsing and searching through information wiki allows non linear evolving complex and networked text while also allowing for editor argument debate and interaction regarding the content and formatting defining characteristic of wiki technology is the ease with which pages can be created and updated generally there is no review by moderator or gatekeeper before modifications are accepted and thus lead to changes on the website many wikis are open to alteration by the general public without requiring registration of user accounts many edits can be made in real time and appear almost instantly online but this feature facilitates abuse of the system private wiki servers require user authentication to edit pages and sometimes even to read them maged kamel boulos cito maramba and steve wheeler write that the open wikis produce process of social darwinism because of the openness and rapidity that wiki pages can be edited the pages undergo an evolutionary selection process not unlike that which nature subjects to living organisms unfit sentences and sections are ruthlessly culled edited and replaced if they are not considered fit which hopefully results in the evolution of higher quality and more relevant page editing wikitext redirects here for the wikipedia help page see

or manually entering plaintext signature due to unfamiliarity with the idiosyncratic particulars involved in communication on mediawiki discussion pages on the other hand the format of these discussion pages has been cited as strength by one educator who stated that it provides more fine grain capabilities for discussion than traditional threaded discussion forums for example instead of replying to an entire message the participant in discussion can create hyperlink to new wiki page on any word from the original page discussions are easier to follow since the content is available via hyperlinked wiki page rather than series of reply messages on traditional threaded discussion forum however except in few cases students were not using this capability possibly because of their familiarity with the traditional linear discussion style and lack of guidance on how to make the content more link rich mediawiki by default has little support for the creation of dynamically assembled documents or pages that aggregate data from other pages some research has been done on enabling such features directly within mediawiki the semantic mediawiki extension provides these features it is not in use on wikipedia but in more than 1 600 other mediawiki installations the wikibase repository and wikibase repository client are however implemented in wikidata and wikipedia respectively and to some extent provides semantic web features and linking of centrally stored data to infoboxes in various wikipedia articles upgrading mediawiki is usually fully automated requiring no changes to the site content or template programming historically troubles have been encountered when upgrading from significantly older versions security mediawiki developers have enacted security standards both for core code and extensions sql queries and html output are usually done through wrapper functions that handle validation escaping filtering for prevention of cross site scripting and sql injection many security issues have had to be patched after mediawiki version release and accordingly mediawiki org states the most important security step you can take is to keep your software up to date by subscribing to the announcement listserv and installing security updates that are announced developer community mediawiki developers are spread around the world though with majority in the united states and europe face to face meetings and programming sessions for mediawiki developers have been held once or several times year since 2004 support support for mediawiki users consists of mediawiki org including the support desk an official mailing list mediawiki several books

or manually entering plaintext signature due to unfamiliarity with the idiosyncratic particulars involved in communication on mediawiki discussion pages on the other hand the format of these discussion pages has been cited as strength by one educator who stated that it provides more fine grain capabilities for discussion than traditional threaded discussion forums for example instead of replying to an entire message the participant in discussion can create hyperlink to new wiki page on any word from the original page discussions are easier to follow since the content is available via hyperlinked wiki page rather than series of reply messages on traditional threaded discussion forum however except in few cases students were not using this capability possibly because of their familiarity with the traditional linear discussion style and lack of guidance on how to make the content more link rich mediawiki by default has little support for the creation of dynamically assembled documents or pages that aggregate data from other pages some research has been done on enabling such features directly within mediawiki the semantic mediawiki extension provides these features it is not in use on wikipedia but in more than 1 600 other mediawiki installations the wikibase repository and wikibase repository client are however implemented in wikidata and wikipedia respectively and to some extent provides semantic web features and linking of centrally stored data to infoboxes in various wikipedia articles upgrading mediawiki is usually fully automated requiring no changes to the site content or template programming historically troubles have been encountered when upgrading from significantly older versions security mediawiki developers have enacted security standards both for core code and extensions sql queries and html output are usually done through wrapper functions that handle validation escaping filtering for prevention of cross site scripting and sql injection many security issues have had to be patched after mediawiki version release and accordingly mediawiki org states the most important security step you can take is to keep your software up to date by subscribing to the announcement listserv and installing security updates that are announced developer community mediawiki developers are spread around the world though with majority in the united states and europe face to face meetings and programming sessions for mediawiki developers have been held once or several times year since 2004 support support for mediawiki users consists of mediawiki org including the support desk an official mailing list mediawiki several books

ward cunningham inventor of the wiki ward cunningham and co author bo leuf in their book the wiki way quick collaboration on the web described the essence of the wiki concept as follows wiki invites all users not just experts to edit any page or to create new pages within the wiki web site using only standard plain vanilla web browser without any extra add ons wiki promotes meaningful topic associations between different pages by making page link creation intuitively easy and showing whether an intended target page exists or not wiki is not carefully crafted site created by experts and professional writers and designed for casual visitors instead it seeks to involve the typical visitor user in an ongoing process of creation and collaboration that constantly changes the website landscape wiki enables communities of editors and contributors to write documents collaboratively all that people require to contribute is computer internet access web browser and basic understanding of simple markup language g mediawiki markup language single page in wiki website is referred to as wiki page while the entire collection of pages which are usually well interconnected by hyperlinks is the wiki wiki is essentially database for creating browsing and searching through information wiki allows non linear evolving complex and networked text while also allowing for editor argument debate and interaction regarding the content and formatting defining characteristic of wiki technology is the ease with which pages can be created and updated generally there is no review by moderator or gatekeeper before modifications are accepted and thus lead to changes on the website many wikis are open to alteration by the general public without requiring registration of user accounts many edits can be made in real time and appear almost instantly online but this feature facilitates abuse of the system private wiki servers require user authentication to edit pages and sometimes even to read them maged kamel boulos cito maramba and steve wheeler write that the open wikis produce process of social darwinism because of the openness and rapidity that wiki pages can be edited the pages undergo an evolutionary selection process not unlike that which nature subjects to living organisms unfit sentences and sections are ruthlessly culled edited and replaced if they are not considered fit which hopefully results in the evolution of higher quality and more relevant page editing wikitext redirects here for the wikipedia help page see

product backlog the product backlog is breakdown of work to be done and contains an ordered list of product requirements that scrum team maintains for product common formats include user stories and use cases the requirements define features bug fixes non functional requirements etc whatever must be done to deliver viable product the product owner prioritizes product backlog items pbis based on considerations such as risk business value dependencies size and date needed the product backlog is what will be delivered ordered into the sequence in which it should be delivered it is visible to everyone but may only be changed with the consent of the product owner who is ultimately responsible for ordering product backlog items for the development team to choose the product backlog contains the product owner assessment of business value and the development team assessment of development effort which are often but not always stated in story points using the rounded fibonacci scale these estimates help the product owner to gauge the timeline and may influence the ordering of product backlog items for example if two features have the same business value the product owner may schedule earlier delivery of the one with the lower development effort because the return on investment is higher or the one with higher development effort because it is more complex or riskier and they want to retire that risk earlier the product backlog and the business value of each product backlog item is the responsibility of the product owner the effort to deliver each item is estimated by the development team in story points or time by estimating in story points the team reduces the dependency in individual developers this is useful especially in dynamic teams where developers are often assigned to other projects after sprint delivery for instance if user story is estimated as 5 in effort using fibonacci sequence it remains 5 regardless of how many developers are working on it story points define the effort in time box so they do not change with time for instance in one hour an individual can walk run or climb but the effort expended is clearly different the gap progression between the terms in the fibonacci sequence encourages the team to deliver carefully considered estimates estimates of 1 2 or 3 imply similar efforts 1 being trivial but if the team estimates an 8 or 13 or higher the impact

or manually entering plaintext signature due to unfamiliarity with the idiosyncratic particulars involved in communication on mediawiki discussion pages on the other hand the format of these discussion pages has been cited as strength by one educator who stated that it provides more fine grain capabilities for discussion than traditional threaded discussion forums for example instead of replying to an entire message the participant in discussion can create hyperlink to new wiki page on any word from the original page discussions are easier to follow since the content is available via hyperlinked wiki page rather than series of reply messages on traditional threaded discussion forum however except in few cases students were not using this capability possibly because of their familiarity with the traditional linear discussion style and lack of guidance on how to make the content more link rich mediawiki by default has little support for the creation of dynamically assembled documents or pages that aggregate data from other pages some research has been done on enabling such features directly within mediawiki the semantic mediawiki extension provides these features it is not in use on wikipedia but in more than 1 600 other mediawiki installations the wikibase repository and wikibase repository client are however implemented in wikidata and wikipedia respectively and to some extent provides semantic web features and linking of centrally stored data to infoboxes in various wikipedia articles upgrading mediawiki is usually fully automated requiring no changes to the site content or template programming historically troubles have been encountered when upgrading from significantly older versions security mediawiki developers have enacted security standards both for core code and extensions sql queries and html output are usually done through wrapper functions that handle validation escaping filtering for prevention of cross site scripting and sql injection many security issues have had to be patched after mediawiki version release and accordingly mediawiki org states the most important security step you can take is to keep your software up to date by subscribing to the announcement listserv and installing security updates that are announced developer community mediawiki developers are spread around the world though with majority in the united states and europe face to face meetings and programming sessions for mediawiki developers have been held once or several times year since 2004 support support for mediawiki users consists of mediawiki org including the support desk an official mailing list mediawiki several books

support that one organization or individual bestows to another for other uses see patronage disambiguation patron redirects here for other uses see patron disambiguation patronage is the support encouragement privilege or financial aid that an organization or individual bestows to another in the history of art arts patronage refers to the support that kings popes and the wealthy have provided to artists such as musicians painters and sculptors it can also refer to the right of bestowing offices or church benefices the business given to store by regular customer and the guardianship of saints the word patron derives from the latin patronus patron one who gives benefits to his clients see patronage in ancient rome in some countries the term is used to describe political patronage which is the use of state resources to reward individuals for their electoral support some patronage systems are legal as in the canadian tradition of the prime minister to appoint senators and the heads of number of commissions and agencies in many cases these appointments go to people who have supported the political party of the prime minister as well the term may refer to type of corruption or favoritism in which party in power rewards groups families or ethnicities for their electoral support using illegal gifts or fraudulently awarded appointments or government contracts in many latin american countries patronage developed as means of population control concentrating economic and political power in small minority which held privileges that the majority of the population did not in this system the patrón holds authority and influence over less powerful person whom he protects by granting favors in exchange for loyalty and allegiance with roots in feudalism the system was designed to maintain an inexpensive subservient labor force which could be utilized to limit production costs and allow wealth and its privileges to be monopolized by small elite long after slavery and other forms of bondage like the encomienda and repartimiento systems were abolished patronage was used to maintain rigid class structures with the rise of labor class traditional patronage changed in the 20th century to allow some participation in power structures but many systems still favor small powerful elite who distributes economic and political favors in exchange for benefits to the lower classes contents 1 arts 2 charity 3 commercial 4 ecclesiastical 4 1 anglican 4 2 catholic 4 2 1 patronage of our lady 4
netflow architecture using standalone probes netflow collection using standalone netflow probes is an alternative to flow collection from routers and switches this approach can overcome some limitations of router based netflow monitoring the probes are transparently connected to the monitored link as passive appliance using the tap or span port of the appliance historically netflow monitoring is easier to implement in dedicated probe than in router however this approach also has some drawbacks probes must be deployed on every link that must be observed causing additional hardware setup and maintenance costs probes will not report separate input and output interface information like report from router would probes may have problems reporting reliably the netflow fields related to routing like as numbers or ip masks because they can hardly be expected to use exactly the same routing information as router the easiest way to address the above drawbacks is to use packet capture appliance inline in front of the router and capture all of the netflow output from the router this method allows for storage of large amount of netflow data typically many years worth of data and does not require reconfiguration of the network netflow collection from dedicated probes is well suited for observation of critical links whereas netflow on routers provides network wide view of the traffic that can be used for capacity planning accounting performance monitoring and security history netflow was originally cisco packet switching technology for cisco routers implemented in ios 11 around 1996 it was originally software implementation for the cisco 7000 7200 and 7500 where it was thought as an improvement over the then current cisco fast switching netflow was invented by darren kerr and barry bruin from cisco s patent 6 243 667 the idea was that the first packet of flow would create netflow switching record this record would then be used for all later packets of the same flow until the expiration of the flow only the first packet of flow would require an investigation of the route table to find the most specific matching route this is an expensive operation in software implementations especially the old ones without forwarding information base the netflow switching record was actually some kind of route cache record and old versions of ios still refer to the netflow cache as ip route cache this technology was advantageous for local networks this was especially true if some

ward cunningham inventor of the wiki ward cunningham and co author bo leuf in their book the wiki way quick collaboration on the web described the essence of the wiki concept as follows wiki invites all users not just experts to edit any page or to create new pages within the wiki web site using only standard plain vanilla web browser without any extra add ons wiki promotes meaningful topic associations between different pages by making page link creation intuitively easy and showing whether an intended target page exists or not wiki is not carefully crafted site created by experts and professional writers and designed for casual visitors instead it seeks to involve the typical visitor user in an ongoing process of creation and collaboration that constantly changes the website landscape wiki enables communities of editors and contributors to write documents collaboratively all that people require to contribute is computer internet access web browser and basic understanding of simple markup language g mediawiki markup language single page in wiki website is referred to as wiki page while the entire collection of pages which are usually well interconnected by hyperlinks is the wiki wiki is essentially database for creating browsing and searching through information wiki allows non linear evolving complex and networked text while also allowing for editor argument debate and interaction regarding the content and formatting defining characteristic of wiki technology is the ease with which pages can be created and updated generally there is no review by moderator or gatekeeper before modifications are accepted and thus lead to changes on the website many wikis are open to alteration by the general public without requiring registration of user accounts many edits can be made in real time and appear almost instantly online but this feature facilitates abuse of the system private wiki servers require user authentication to edit pages and sometimes even to read them maged kamel boulos cito maramba and steve wheeler write that the open wikis produce process of social darwinism because of the openness and rapidity that wiki pages can be edited the pages undergo an evolutionary selection process not unlike that which nature subjects to living organisms unfit sentences and sections are ruthlessly culled edited and replaced if they are not considered fit which hopefully results in the evolution of higher quality and more relevant page editing wikitext redirects here for the wikipedia help page see

git design is synthesis of torvalds experience with linux in maintaining large distributed development project along with his intimate knowledge of file system performance gained from the same project and the urgent need to produce working system in short order these influences led to the following implementation choices strong support for non linear development git supports rapid branching and merging and includes specific tools for visualizing and navigating non linear development history in git core assumption is that change will be merged more often than it is written as it is passed around to various reviewers in git branches are very lightweight branch is only reference to one commit with its parental commits the full branch structure can be constructed distributed development like darcs bitkeeper mercurial bazaar and monotone git gives each developer local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another these changes are imported as added development branches and can be merged in the same way as locally developed branch compatibility with existent systems and protocols repositories can be published via hypertext transfer protocol http file transfer protocol ftp or git protocol over either plain socket or secure shell ssh git also has cvs server emulation which enables the use of existent cvs clients and ide plugins to access git repositories subversion repositories can be used directly with git svn efficient handling of large projects torvalds has described git as being very fast and scalable and performance tests done by mozilla showed that it was an order of magnitude faster than some version control systems fetching version history from locally stored repository can be one hundred times faster than fetching it from the remote server cryptographic authentication of history the git history is stored in such way that the id of particular version commit in git terms depends upon the complete development history leading up to that commit once it is published it is not possible to change the old versions without it being noticed the structure is similar to merkle tree but with added data at the nodes and leaves mercurial and monotone also have this property toolkit based design git was designed as set of programs written in and several shell scripts that provide wrappers around those programs although most of those scripts have since been rewritten in for speed and portability the design remains and it is

antoine laurent lavoisier by jules dalou 1866 lavoisier fundamental contributions to chemistry were result of conscious effort to fit all experiments into the framework of single theory he established the consistent use of the chemical balance used oxygen to overthrow the phlogiston theory and developed new system of chemical nomenclature which held that oxygen was an essential constituent of all acids which later turned out to be erroneous lavoisier also did early research in physical chemistry and thermodynamics in joint experiments with laplace they used calorimeter to estimate the heat evolved per unit of carbon dioxide produced eventually finding the same ratio for flame and animals indicating that animals produced energy by type of combustion reaction lavoisier also contributed to early ideas on composition and chemical changes by stating the radical theory believing that radicals which function as single group in chemical process combine with oxygen in reactions he also introduced the possibility of allotropy in chemical elements when he discovered that diamond is crystalline form of carbon he was also responsible for the construction of the gasometer an expensive instrument he used at his demonstrations while he used his gasometer exclusively for these he also created smaller cheaper more practical gasometers that worked with sufficient degree of precision that more chemists could recreate he was essentially theorist and his great merit lay in his capacity to take over experimental work that others had carried out without always adequately recognizing their claims and by rigorous logical procedure reinforced by his own quantitative experiments expounding the true explanation of the results he completed the work of black priestley and cavendish and gave correct explanation of their experiments overall his contributions are considered the most important in advancing chemistry to the level reached in physics and mathematics during the 18th century awards and honours during his lifetime lavoisier was awarded gold medal by the king of france for his work on urban street lighting 1766 and was appointed to the french academy of sciences 1768 lavoisier work was recognized as an international historic chemical landmark by the american chemical society académie des sciences de institut de france and the société chimique de france in 1999 antoine laurent lavoisier louis 1788 publication entitled méthode de nomenclature chimique published with colleagues louis bernard guyton de morveau claude louis berthollet and antoine françois comte de fourcroy was honored by citation for chemical breakthrough award from

or manually entering plaintext signature due to unfamiliarity with the idiosyncratic particulars involved in communication on mediawiki discussion pages on the other hand the format of these discussion pages has been cited as strength by one educator who stated that it provides more fine grain capabilities for discussion than traditional threaded discussion forums for example instead of replying to an entire message the participant in discussion can create hyperlink to new wiki page on any word from the original page discussions are easier to follow since the content is available via hyperlinked wiki page rather than series of reply messages on traditional threaded discussion forum however except in few cases students were not using this capability possibly because of their familiarity with the traditional linear discussion style and lack of guidance on how to make the content more link rich mediawiki by default has little support for the creation of dynamically assembled documents or pages that aggregate data from other pages some research has been done on enabling such features directly within mediawiki the semantic mediawiki extension provides these features it is not in use on wikipedia but in more than 1 600 other mediawiki installations the wikibase repository and wikibase repository client are however implemented in wikidata and wikipedia respectively and to some extent provides semantic web features and linking of centrally stored data to infoboxes in various wikipedia articles upgrading mediawiki is usually fully automated requiring no changes to the site content or template programming historically troubles have been encountered when upgrading from significantly older versions security mediawiki developers have enacted security standards both for core code and extensions sql queries and html output are usually done through wrapper functions that handle validation escaping filtering for prevention of cross site scripting and sql injection many security issues have had to be patched after mediawiki version release and accordingly mediawiki org states the most important security step you can take is to keep your software up to date by subscribing to the announcement listserv and installing security updates that are announced developer community mediawiki developers are spread around the world though with majority in the united states and europe face to face meetings and programming sessions for mediawiki developers have been held once or several times year since 2004 support support for mediawiki users consists of mediawiki org including the support desk an official mailing list mediawiki several books

intelligent code completion is context aware code completion feature in some programming environments that speeds up the process of coding applications by reducing typos and other common mistakes attempts to do this are usually done through auto completion popups when typing querying parameters of functions query hints related to syntax errors etc intelligent code completion and related tools serve as documentation and disambiguation for variable names functions and methods using reflection intelligent code completion appears in many program environments example implementations being atom autocomplete and visual studio intellisense the term was originally popularized as picklist and some implementations still refer to it as such contents 1 overview 2 history 3 support in editors and ides 3 1 visual studio 3 2 eclipse 3 3 vim 4 example 5 notes 6 external links overview similar to other autocompletion systems intelligent code completion is convenient way to access descriptions of functions particularly their parameter lists it speeds up software development by reducing the amount of name memorization needed and keyboard input required it also allows for less reference to external documentation as interactive documentation on many symbols e variables and functions in the active scope appears dynamically in the form of tooltips while programming intelligent code completion works using an automatically generated in memory database of classes variable names and other constructs that the application being edited defines or references the classic implementation of intellisense works by detecting marker characters such as periods or other separator characters depending on the language when the user types one of these characters immediately after the name of an entity having one or more accessible members such as contained variables or functions intellisense suggests matches in pop up window the user can either accept the suggestion by typing statement completion character tab or enter or language specific marker such as the semicolon for or continue typing the name over time intellisense determines which variable or function the user most likely wants the feature also lets the user select from number of overloaded functions in languages that support object oriented programming intellisense also displays short description of function in the pop up window depending on the amount of documentation in the function source code history several of the original components of an intelligent code completion system were designed and invented by gail kaiser professor at columbia university department of computer science she created many of the basic

in software engineering dependency injection is technique in which an object receives other objects that it depends on these other objects are called dependencies in the typical using relationship the receiving object is called client and the passed that is injected object is called service the code that passes the service to the client can be many kinds of things and is called the injector instead of the client specifying which service it will use the injector tells the client what service to use the injection refers to the passing of dependency service into the object client that would use it the service is made part of the client state passing the service to the client rather than allowing client to build or find the service is the fundamental requirement of the pattern the intent behind dependency injection is to achieve separation of concerns of construction and use of objects this can increase readability and code reuse dependency injection is one form of the broader technique of inversion of control client who wants to call some services should not have to know how to construct those services instead the client delegates the responsibility of providing its services to external code the injector the client is not allowed to call the injector code it is the injector that constructs the services the injector then injects passes the services into the client which might already exist or may also be constructed by the injector the client then uses the services this means the client does not need to know about the injector how to construct the services or even which actual services it is using the client only needs to know about the intrinsic interfaces of the services because these define how the client may use the services this separates the responsibility of use from the responsibility of construction contents 1 intent 2 overview 2 1 taxonomy 2 2 dependency injection frameworks 2 3 advantages 2 4 disadvantages 3 structure 3 1 uml class and sequence diagram 4 examples 4 1 without dependency injection 4 2 types of dependency injection 4 2 1 other types 4 2 2 constructor injection 4 2 3 setter injection 4 2 4 interface injection 4 2 5 constructor injection comparison 4 2 6 setter injection comparison 4 2 7 interface injection comparison 4 3 assembling examples 4 4 assembly comparison 4 5 dependency injection pattern 4

for other types of responsibility see responsibility disambiguation social responsibility is an ethical framework and suggests that an individual has an obligation to work and cooperate with other individuals and organizations for the benefit of society at large social responsibility is duty every individual has to perform so as to maintain balance between the economy and the ecosystems trade off may exist between economic development in the material sense and the welfare of the society and environment though this has been challenged by many reports over the past decade social responsibility means sustaining the equilibrium between the two it pertains not only to business organizations but also to everyone whose any action impacts the environment it is concept that aims to ensure secure healthcare for the people living in rural areas and eliminate all barriers like distance financial condition etc this responsibility can be passive by avoiding engaging in socially harmful acts or active by performing activities that directly advance social goals social responsibility must be intergenerational since the actions of one generation have consequences on those following businesses can use ethical decision making to secure their businesses by making decisions that allow for government agencies to minimize their involvement with the corporation for instance if company follows the united states environmental protection agency epa guidelines for emissions on dangerous pollutants and even goes an extra step to get involved in the community and address those concerns that the public might have they would be less likely to have the epa investigate them for environmental concerns significant element of current thinking about privacy however stresses self regulation rather than market or government mechanisms for protecting personal information according to some experts most rules and regulations are formed due to public outcry which threatens profit maximization and therefore the well being of the shareholder and that if there is not an outcry there often will be limited regulation some critics argue that corporate social responsibility csr distracts from the fundamental economic role of businesses others argue that it is nothing more than superficial window dressing or greenwashing others argue that it is an attempt to pre empt the role of governments as watchdog over powerful corporations though there is no systematic evidence to support these criticisms significant number of studies have shown no negative influence on shareholder results from csr but rather slightly negative correlation with improved shareholder returns contents 1

an entity relationship model or er model describes interrelated things of interest in specific domain of knowledge basic er model is composed of entity types which classify the things of interest and specifies relationships that can exist between entities instances of those entity types an entity attribute relationship diagram for mmorpg using chen notation in software engineering an er model is commonly formed to represent things business needs to remember in order to perform business processes consequently the er model becomes an abstract data model that defines data or information structure which can be implemented in database typically relational database entity relationship modeling was developed for database and design by peter chen and published in 1976 paper with variants of the idea existing previously some er models show super and subtype entities connected by generalization specialization relationships and an er model can be used also in the specification of domain specific ontologies contents 1 introduction 2 entity relationship model 2 1 mapping natural language 2 2 relationships roles and cardinalities 2 3 role naming 2 4 cardinalities 2 5 crow foot notation 2 6 model usability issues 3 entity relationships and semantic modeling 3 1 semantic model 3 2 extension model 3 3 entity relationship origins 3 3 1 philosophical alignment 4 limitations 5 see also 6 references 7 further reading 8 external links introduction an r model is usually the result of systematic analysis to define and describe what is important to processes in an area of business it does not define the business processes it only presents business data schema in graphical form it is usually drawn in graphical form as boxes entities that are connected by lines relationships which express the associations and dependencies between entities an er model can also be expressed in verbal form for example one building may be divided into zero or more apartments but one apartment can only be located in one building entities may be characterized not only by relationships but also by additional properties attributes which include identifiers called primary keys diagrams created to represent attributes as well as entities and relationships may be called entity attribute relationship diagrams rather than entity relationship models an er model is typically implemented as database in simple relational database implementation each row of table represents one instance of an entity type and each field in table represents an attribute type in relational database

or manually entering plaintext signature due to unfamiliarity with the idiosyncratic particulars involved in communication on mediawiki discussion pages on the other hand the format of these discussion pages has been cited as strength by one educator who stated that it provides more fine grain capabilities for discussion than traditional threaded discussion forums for example instead of replying to an entire message the participant in discussion can create hyperlink to new wiki page on any word from the original page discussions are easier to follow since the content is available via hyperlinked wiki page rather than series of reply messages on traditional threaded discussion forum however except in few cases students were not using this capability possibly because of their familiarity with the traditional linear discussion style and lack of guidance on how to make the content more link rich mediawiki by default has little support for the creation of dynamically assembled documents or pages that aggregate data from other pages some research has been done on enabling such features directly within mediawiki the semantic mediawiki extension provides these features it is not in use on wikipedia but in more than 1 600 other mediawiki installations the wikibase repository and wikibase repository client are however implemented in wikidata and wikipedia respectively and to some extent provides semantic web features and linking of centrally stored data to infoboxes in various wikipedia articles upgrading mediawiki is usually fully automated requiring no changes to the site content or template programming historically troubles have been encountered when upgrading from significantly older versions security mediawiki developers have enacted security standards both for core code and extensions sql queries and html output are usually done through wrapper functions that handle validation escaping filtering for prevention of cross site scripting and sql injection many security issues have had to be patched after mediawiki version release and accordingly mediawiki org states the most important security step you can take is to keep your software up to date by subscribing to the announcement listserv and installing security updates that are announced developer community mediawiki developers are spread around the world though with majority in the united states and europe face to face meetings and programming sessions for mediawiki developers have been held once or several times year since 2004 support support for mediawiki users consists of mediawiki org including the support desk an official mailing list mediawiki several books
