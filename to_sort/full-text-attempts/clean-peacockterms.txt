40th transport squadron at duncan field texas and was assigned to the 317th transport group three days later beginning with only second lieutenant fred schomburg squadron commander and eight enlisted men the squadron slowly took shape and in about four months was full sized at this time it transferred to bowman field kentucky where it began flying the douglas 47 skytrain the pace of developments in world war ii drove rapid training and deployment schedule and on 6 december 1942 the 40th moved to laurinburg maxton army air base north carolina to begin staging for its move to the pacific few days later the squadron left north carolina for the mobile air depot alabama where it received thirteen new 47s after they checked out the airplanes the squadron flew to california world war ii operations on 5 january 1943 the squadron left california for the southwest pacific theater two days later it landed at brisbane australia where it came under the command of the fifth air force after short time in brisbane the squadron moved to garbutt field townsville australia the squadron first permanent oversees home buna in the buna campaign the 40th ferried food ammunition equipment and reinforcements to allied troops then evacuated the wounded to hospitals on its return flights as the battle of buna neared its end the fight for wau was just beginning wau at wau papua new guinea the squadron supported australian commandos known as the kanga force who were harassing the japanese squadron pilots soon became accustomed to landing on the 3 000 foot dirt strip at wau with its 12 per cent grade heading directly at kainde mountain the crews flew in reinforcements ammunition artillery pieces food and other supplies wau saw the 40th first combat casualties when crew crashed while attempting to land on 18 january on 29 january the japanese began full scale assault on the airstrip they managed to reach one end of the runway which they placed under constant mortar fire at times planes circled as the australians fought the japanese far enough back into the jungle to allow the aircraft to land many of the reinforcements flown into the strip jumped from the planes straight into the battle with their guns firing by the end of 30 january most of the japanese attacks had been repulsed and the airstrip remained in allied hands for the remainder of the war the 40th troop carrier squadron received its first distinguished unit citation for its efforts at wau consolidation after these two battles the 40th established and operated air routes across australia new guinea and the solomon islands the pace of operations did not slacken and the squadron engaged in wide variety of tactical airlift actions primarily these included airlifting troops reinforcements supplies and equipment into combat and evacuating the wounded it dropped paratroopers during airborne assault operations and delivered equipment and supplies by airdrop other secondary missions included carrying captured japanese troops to rear areas providing quick transportation for commanders to and from combat areas and conducting training with airborne troops assault on lae the 40th next major battle occurred on 5 september when allied forces assaulted the island of lae the squadron joined the rest of the 317th troop carrier group in an air assault on the nadzab plain general kenney fifth air force commander later said truly don believe that another air force in the world today could have put this over as perfectly as the fifth air force did three hundred and two airplanes in all taking off from eight different fields in the moresby and dobodura areas made rendezvous right on the nose over marilinan flying through clouds passes in the mountains and over the top not single squadron did any circling or stalling around but all slid into place like clockwork and proceeded on the final flight down the watut valley turned to the right down the markham river and went directly to the target move across new guinea as allied troops pressed westward across new guinea the squadron moved to ward airdrome at port moresby this move accomplished on 6 october 1943 placed the squadron closer to combat and eliminated many of the long flights back to australia the 317th group soon became known as the jungle skippers heavily loaded and unarmed the 47s were often flown unconventionally by their hard pressed crews counting on stealth and surprise to help even the odds the pilots slipped their transports down river valleys and through mountain gaps skipping and skimming across the jungle and rain forests throughout the rest of 1943 and into 1944 the 40th continued its support of the allied advance on 21 april 1944 the squadron moved to finschhafen new guinea and again in may to cyclops field hollandia invasion of the philippines during operation table tennis the 40th airdropped troops on the island of noemfoor during july 1944 in november the squadron airdropped supplies to american troops on the island of leyte in the philippines in january 1945 the squadron transferred to leyte from there it made covert airdrops to filipino guerrillas and commandos operating throughout the island chain the squadron last major action of world war ii came on 16 february with the invasion of luzon the 317th group was tasked with dropping the 503rd parachute infantry regiment troopers onto corregidorc the only suitable drop zones were an old american parade ground and golf course at precisely 0830 fifty one 47s began wheeling over the two small drop zones in counter rotating orbits dropping eight men per pass with colonel jack lackey the 317th group commander in the lead aircraft the 39th and 40th squadrons dropped on the former golf course while the 41st and 46th squadrons racetracked to drop on the parade ground while most of the aircraft were hit by intense ground fire none were lost for its efforts in this assault the squadron won its second distinguished unit citation the squadron also participated in the airdrop of the 11th airborne division on mindoro island and the airdrop of the 511th parachute infantry regiment on los banos on the batangas peninsula of luzon in february 1945 the squadron carried the most valuable cargo ever moved in the southwest pacific theater it brought 120 doctors and nurses to mabalacat to care for american prisoners liberated from japanese prisoner of war camps after three years of imprisonment in march the squadron moved to clark field philippines while at clark the squadron dealt with raids by fanatical japanese who penetrated the security around clark to make hit and run attacks against the barracks and flight line on 15 april the squadron launched short career as strategic bombing squadron japanese troops holed up on carabao island cavite were threatening allied shipping conventional bombing failed to make an impact so the 40th c 47s were loaded with 55 gallon drums filled with napalm these were rolled out of the cargo doors and were credited with killing 2700 japanese move to okinawa in august the squadron moved this time to naha airfield okinawa on 6 august the first nuclear weapon was dropped on hiroshima three days later the united states dropped another on nagasaki on 14 august the japanese agreed to surrender on 29 august four 40th 47s flew from naha to tokyo carrying an advance party for the surrender ceremony these were the first us aircraft to land on the japanese homeland at the end of hostilities however the occasion was marred when the lead aircraft misinterpreted the direction of the wind while coming in to land this caused the entire formation to land downwind much to the consternation of the japanese commander who had assembled his staff at the correct end of the runway to greet the arriving victors occupation of japan after the surrender of the japanese the 40th took part in the occupation of japan in 1947 the squadron received new douglas 54 skymasters the squadron became the 40th troop carrier squadron heavy in may 1948 and was assigned to far east air forces european operations berlin airlift in june 1948 the soviet union attempted to force its wartime allies now cold war enemies france great britain and the united states from the city of berlin the allied powers immediately began an airlift into the city but it soon became apparent that they needed more aircraft in september the 39th and 41st squadrons from the 317th troop carrier group were transferred to germany in november the 40th followed soon after arriving in germany the 40th began flying into berlin from wiesbaden air base germany before transferring to raf celle germany in december from the time the 40th began operating at wiesbaden until shortly after the berlin blockade was lifted the following summer the squadron flew approximately 10 550 round trips to berlin transporting grand total of 100 000 tons of supplies into the besieged city when the berlin

squadron received its first lockheed 130 hercules two months later the squadron transferred from neubiberg air base to évreux fauville air base france the 40th completed its transition into the 130 in june 1958 just in time for the new plane to gain its first taste of action lebanese civil war when lebanon exploded into civil war in july 1958 the 40th both airlifted personnel equipment and supplies of the 24th infantry division into beirut and deployed aircraft to incirlik combined defense installation turkey the squadron continued to fly into lebanon until october 1959 when the civil war ended and the troops moved out congo crisis on 1 july 1960 belgium granted the congo its independence within week the country had descended into anarchy the locals began slaughtering europeans and looting and burning all european built buildings businesses and facilities when belgium sent in its dragon rouge paratroopers they responded with similar ferocity against the local population the united nations quickly moved to stop the carnage and restore order to the area on 8 july the 40th as part of the 322d air division went on alert for action in operation new tape the congo airlift from july and well into the next year the squadron flew across most of africa carrying troops and hundreds of tons of cargo into the congo from the very beginning all 40th aircrews were involved in the airlift the first un aircraft to land in the congo was 40th 130 carrying lt col francis merritt commander of the 40th he was tasked as the combat airlift support unit commander most of the airport facilities had been destroyed and the one forklift which lt col merritt crew brought with them soon broke despite the many problems and continuing unrest including heavy gun battles around the airport the ground crews under lt col merritt continued to unload each arriving 130 frequently by hand as the airlift developed missions spread to include landings at dirt strips and runways throughout the region crews from the 40th found themselves eating rations cooked at tiny jungle airstrips they carried thousands of refugees and troops from nations as far away as algeria south africa morocco and somalia the massive operation in support of the united nations continued until the summer of 1961 iranian earthquake main article 1962 buin zahra earthquake the 40th continued its humanitarian efforts in 1962 when hit iran within hours of the disaster 40th aircraft were in the air loaded with supplies for the people of iran the 40th flew nearly third of all missions flown into iran carrying rations tents blankets 100 bed hospital and several helicopters sino indian war in 1962 the 40th took part in another little publicized but highly critical mission airlift operations in the sino indian war on 21 november 1962 twelve 130s departed france on mass deployment to new delhi india the deployed to support the indian government in its defense against an invasion by communist china all of the aircraft arrived in new delhi on 23 november twenty four hours ahead of schedule when china invaded india the indian air force russian built transports proved incapable of carrying troops and equipment into the high altitude himalayan airfields the 40th c 130as easily handled the altitude and quickly carried all of the indian reinforcements and equipment into the area during the first eleven days the twelve crews carried over five hundred tons of supplies and over 5000 troops for total of 203 sorties without an aborted launch the mission was originally to last only few months but as usual stretched out for over year the indian government later stated that the efforts of the american 130s prevented the chinese from gaining any advantage after their initial invasion skopje earthquake main article 1963 skopje earthquake as the indian airlift wound down in 1963 the squadron was again called upon for humanitarian assistance this time to belgrade yugoslavia an earthquake had devastated the town of skopje killing and injuring thousands of people three crews from the 40th flew in the initial group of 130s carrying relief supplies into the area united states move to ohio in november 1963 the 317th troop carrier group began planning its move from évreux fauville air base france to its new home lockbourne air force base ohio in june 1964 the 40th returned to the united states for the first time since january 1943 during its many years away from the united states the squadron had flown combat operations stretching from the far east to the middle east and humanitarian missions throughout europe the middle east and africa it was now time for the squadron to relax or so it thought invasion of the dominican republic in april 1965 the dominican republic elected socialist president the united states encouraged the dominican military to stage coup which degenerated into civil war between the army and supporters of the democratic system president lyndon johnson used this situation as an excuse for american intervention the initial plan called for massive airdrop invasion of the island by over one hundred 130s orders went out and the 40th deployed all of its planes to pope air force base north carolina where it joined the invasion force after the formation became airborne the president changed the invasion from an airdrop to an air land assault the 40th diverted into ramey air force base puerto rico to allow the crews to rerig the loads then flew into the dominican republic to combat offload the cargo for the remainder of the operation the 40th flew from both pope and ramey when the fighting ended in june the 40th returned to lockbourne beginning deployments in 1964 the 40th began operation cross switch rotations to europe during these rotations the entire squadron deployed for two to four months each year from ohio to europe to augment the theater airlift forces at first the rotational base was located at évreux fauville france but after the french left nato in 1966 the rotation was split between raf mildenhall england and rhein main air base germany at the same time that the squadron began its regular rotation to europe it also began regular rotation of crews and planes to panama the rotation to panama continued into the 1980s when the air national guard assumed responsibility for it in october 1965 c 130 replacement training unit was established at lockbourne the 40th devoted portion of its training to the unit the sixties and seventies the late 1960s and early 1970s were time of intense social unrest in the united states on several occasions the 40th carried troops into cities ravaged by riots or massive anti vietnam war demonstrations the airlift of riot control troops known as operation garden plot took the 40th from detroit to washington dc to new haven connecticut as the nation began to heal in the seventies these operations slowly dwindled then faded away the social changes that swept through american culture in the sixties impacted the squadron in the seventies in july 1970 lockbourne air force base received its first women the base integrated the women into existing squadrons because it lacked female only squadron which many other bases had at first the commander were unsure of the roles of these new recruits but soon found positions for them in squadron administration in 1973 the all volunteer force came into effect and with higher pay better living conditions and improved facilities as the air force faced the fact that if it did not improve the life style of its troops they would leave the seventies also saw an attempt to form hard crews dismal failure the flight system management nightmare and the removal of maintenance from the squadron then its return then its removal again the seventies also brought the move of all 130s into military airlift command reversal of the consolidation into tactical air command which occurred in the sixties humanitarian operations through all of the changes the mission of the 40th remained the same hurricane camille the worst hurricane in the history of the united states hit the east coast in august 1969 in the first of series of hurricane relief efforts the 40th launched aircraft full of supplies for the stricken area hurricanes continued to decimate the east coast of the united states and the 40th continued to respond hurricanes david and frederick in 1979 hurricane hugo in 1989 and hurricane andrew in 1992 all brought out the 40th on missions of mercy from 1969 on the 40th flew humanitarian mission for litany of disasters mud slides in bogotá colombia in september 1970 an earthquake on the border between peru and ecuador month later floods in bolivia and volcanic eruption in nicaragua in 1971 floods in virginia and pennsylvania in july 1972 and an earthquake in nicaragua six months later in 1973 operation authentic assistance massive drought and famine relief operation in mali an earthquake in turkey in 1976 blizzards in new york in 1977 and again in massachusetts in 1979 all proved the squadron worth as an instrument of humanitarian relief as well as war this is only small handful of the many humanitarian relief operations throughout the history of the 40th to name them all would take far too much space but this short list illustrates the immeasurable service the squadron has given representing the united states to the world pope air force base in june 1971 the 40th began preparations for the 317th tactical airlift wing move this time to pope air force base where it replaced the 778th tactical airlift squadron which inactivated and transferred its personnel and aircraftto the 40th the move to pope brought some mission changes as well the squadron lost its obligation as replacement training unit but gained the adverse weather aerial delivery system awads mission previously 130 squadrons at several bases had awads but it was gradually consolidated into the three squadrons at pope the 40th also gained rotational commitment to southeast asia in addition to its regular rotations to europe and panama it soon became common for crews to spend ninety days in germany come home for few weeks deploy to panama for six weeks come home again for short rest then depart for the pacific vietnam deployments the 40th crews were first based at ching chuan kang air base taiwan and came under the control of the 61st tactical airlift squadron in 1974 they moved to tapao royal thai navy airfield thailand from both bases they flew high altitude awads drops in south vietnam as well as standard airlift missions as many as eight 40th crews could be in the region at one time taking part in combat actions including the sieges of an lộc and phnom penh and operations easter bunny and constant guard the squadron received no official recognition for its involvement in the vietnam war because many of its action in the war came after the united states officially ended its participation at the end of 1974 the 40th pulled its crews out of southeast asia and turned over its responsibility for the adverse weather airdrop mission to the thai air force and bird air regional civilian contract service flying 130s iranian revolution in 1979 while the squadron was on rotation in europe radical muslims overthrew the shah of iran the 40th flew into iran rescuing

invasion of grenada the squadron gained its first combat experience in nearly decade in 1983 fighting among various factions among the island of grenada communist government led to fear that american medical students on the island could be taken hostage president ronald reagan responded with operation urgent fury an invasion of the island the 40th provided two of the five crews for the initial airborne assault on point salines airport after the initial assault the numerous squadron crews flew follow on missions into the island carrying troops supplies food and ammunition on the return trips the crews carried out cuban soldiers who had been working on several large military construction projects and the american medical students who has been caught on the island by the unrest despite outrage on the part of liberals americans the people of grenada profusely thanked the united states from rescuing them from government they did not want invasion of panama relations between the united states and panama former ally of the s deteriorated in the late 1980s by 1989 the two countries were in nearing state of undeclared war that winter president george w bush launched massive invasion operation just cause to remove noriega on 19 december 1989 the 40th joined the other two pope squadrons and the 50th tactical airlift squadron from little rock air force base for fifteen aircraft airborne assault on rio hato airport panama the aircraft launched for late night assault of army rangers after flying down the western caribbean across panama and out over the pacific the formation turned and began its run for rio hato the first few aircraft flew unscathed across the drop zone but panamanian soldiers quickly found their range and poured withering ground fire into the formation after the drop the formation flew to howard air force base panama where the aircraft received hasty repairs and fuel before launching back to the united states many of the planes managed to make it to the coast before landing at commercial airports because of severe battle damage the squadron continued to support just cause into 1990 as the last of the fighting wound down in panama the 40th

days carrying cargo throughout the arabian peninsula living out of tents on the barren island of masirah known to the squadron as moon island while the living conditions were miserable and the missions long and tiring the squadron never gave up everyone pulled together and achieved one great milestone after another making the 130 the backbone of the war effort without it the war could never have happened while cargo poured into the theater by way of strategic air and sealift it took the 130 to distribute it to the troops in january the 40th took part in one of the great deceptions in military history while the fighters and bombers distracted the iraqis the squadron c 130s carried the 82nd airborne division from northeast saudi arabia across the iraqi front line to land the soldiers in the northwest corner of saudi arabia all of these mission were flown under strict radio silence with no navigational aids aircraft flew along corridors often with little or no visibility at the same altitude as other aircraft flying the return route when the ground war began in february the iraqis found division on their western flank they thought was in front of them if not for the 40th and the other 130 squadrons it could not have been done humanitarian operations when the squadron arrived home in march 1991 it was to rest the rest lasted only few months before it was again

airland missions into zagreb and the ravaged city of sarajevo after serbian forces blocked relief convoys from entering n safe areas the squadron resorted to airdrops the intense fighting forced the crews to reintroduce high altitude awads airdrops procedure not used since vietnam and one which the air force had allowed to lapse because it was considered an irrelevant capability dyess afb on 16 july 1993 the 40th was inactivated with the united states victory in the cold war the military began to demobilize as part of this process the squadron and its parent organization the 317th airlift

coastal area of dalmatia to italy in treaties signed on 18 may 1941 by 25 june 1941 poglavnik ante pavelić the leader of the ndh had sent an envoy to berlin to offer volunteers to serve on the eastern front by 2 july hitler had accepted the offer and military units were formed under the supervision of two german army officers the ndh viewed this as means of strengthening its ties with germany

for providing replacements the members of the regiment swore an oath to adolf hitler whilst not an official part of the wehrmacht the regiment was under german military jurisdiction and direct german

to accustom the regiment to the conditions and divisional procedures as well as to further progress their training the units of the regiment were initially divided up among other regiments of the division immediately after their arrival on the front line near kharkov the divisional diary recorded that the main goal for units of the regiment during this period was to improve discipline across various areas to improve poor discipline on 30 september 1941 colonel ivan markulj sent 43 officers and ncos as well as 144 soldiers back to the ndh due to illness and or for disciplinary reasons after the red army counterattacked and re took rostov in november 1941 the 100th light infantry division was marched south to the front line on the mius river on 22 november temperatures dropped as

along the line of the samara river the division held on through the winter starting in early 1942 soldiers of the unit were able to send messages back to the independent state of croatia messages for family members and friends were written on any paper the troops could find such as cigarette papers or pages torn from notebooks communications from the regiment soldiers were subsequently broadcast on radio zagreb later known as hrvatski krugoval alongside propaganda announcements that praised the croatian authorities and did not mention the soldiers fate most often death or capture the commander of the 100th light infantry division generalleutnant werner sanne commended the regiment successes over the winter especially the actions of lieutenant colonel marko mesić artillery battalion on 21 22 february 1942 on 23 february 1942 sanne awarded mesić the iron cross during april 1942 four soldiers of the regiment were sentenced to death and shot while many others were sentenced to imprisonment of between 2 10 years from mid may 1942 the regiment was re united under colonel markulj after which the 100th light infantry division joined in the final phases of the pincer attack on the red army bridgehead at kharkov in june the division supported the drive of the 1st panzer army along the don river through voronezh to kalach where the regiment incurred heavy casualties trying to cross the river in the face of serious resistance after the second battle of kharkov colonel markulj lieutenant eduard bakarec and six other officers of the regiment were awarded the iron cross first class report dated 21 june 1942 states that legion contained 113 officers 7 military clerks 625 ncos and 4317 soldiers as well as 2902 horses after participating in mopping up

desperate hand to hand combat during the german attack on 27 july and subsequent overwhelming soviet counterattack on 28 july the worst recorded casualties before stalingrad were 171 dead suffered in combat in various villages along the samara river lt tomljenović lt tomislav anić and lt ivan malički were killed in action during this period on 24 september 1942 during visit to the 6th army headquarters pavelić decorated and promoted some soldiers of the regiment two days later the 100th light infantry division was committed to the battle of stalingrad 369th legion memorial badge the number of legionnaires from that date was fast reducing to reported total of 1 403 altogether by 21 october 1942 new fresh forces from croatia were not added except for returns of sick and wounded and few officers and staff total of 22 15 officers were killed 38 26 wounded and 66 45 returned to croatia from the original 147 legion officers in total before fall only 20 officers including mesic remained in stalingrad and one is treated as mia lt bakarec who was the first legion soldier ever to receive the iron cross 2nd class was later wounded at stalingrad and evacuated to croatia where he was killed on 5 july 1944 col and later ndh general markulj was tried and executed in belgrade in september 1945 markulj was court martialled and executed after his capture by the allies who extradited him to the yugoslav army in summer 1945 battle of stalingrad the 100th light infantry division including the 369th croatian reinforced infantry regiment was involved in the heavy fighting for the red october factory and for mamayev hill during the battle of stalingrad by november 1942 the fighting in their sector had become locked stalemate with little progress by december 1942 the regiment had seen such intense combat that it was at 1 3 strength despite the harsh conditions the german high command credited the regiment with maintaining proper and military bearing sergeant dragutin podobnik was awarded iron cross second and first class as well as many croat decorations including one personally from pavelic in september 1942 for his actions at stalingrad pavicic ordered strategic building to be captured in the red october factory however the armored vehicle support was delayed podobnik and his 18 men surprised the soviets and captured the building without loss then handed it over to units from the german 54th army group sergeant podobnik was later wounded and evacuated from stalingrad and was killed in spring 1945 whilst serving in pavelic elite unit several distinctions and citations are noted in war diaries and official military documents there are several citations for bravery valor and leadership under fire for men of all ranks including lieutenant rudolf baričević in addition the regimental doctors received distinction for their actions and success in saving lives one notable citation is that of captain madraš who was wounded and was to be flown out of stalingrad but refused and instead stayed and fought with his men there were also acts of insubordination dereliction of duty and cowardly behaviour cited in reports this was common for the demoralized and surrounded german and german allied troops at stalingrad as the conditions were extremely harsh on the soldiers major tomislav brajkovic is noted to have desperately attempted to keep morale and discipline high however due to major disagreements with other officers including his commanding officer he was transferred out of the regiment by 14 january the regiment section of the front line had reduced to 200 held by some 90 remaining troops all suffering from extreme cold hunger fatigue and lack of ammunition colonel viktor pavicic reportedly left resignation letter and disappeared from the theater for good he recommended colonel mesić to general sanne to be his successor general sanne officially reported that pavicic was deserter but sgt erwin juric claimed that pavicic had received written orders signed by sanne to leave stalingrad by air on 15 january during its last days at stalingrad the legion was desperately retraining about 700 inexperienced artillery and support soldiers to infantry combat duty the last official report from 21 january 1943 counted 443 infantry and 444 artillery soldiers in stalingrad just before the surrender of the 6th army at the end of january about 1 000 wounded were flown out and of the remaining men in the regiment nearly 900 became prisoners of war among the last wehrmacht soldiers to leave stalingrad by air were group of 18 wounded and sick croat legionnaires including lt barićević who were flown out by luftwaffe pilots and were landed on the last serviceable german airfield at staljingradskaja near the 369th artillery section positions on the night of 22 to 23 january 1943 the regiment war diary and other documents were also saved in this evacuation the previous night several luftwaffe planes had crashed attempting to take off and land perilously close to fast advancing soviet forces thus fewer planes flew in for rescue missions during the day of 23 january stalingradskaja airfield fell into soviet hands elements of the regiment fought as long as they could but ultimately surrendered to the soviet general vasiljev on 29 or 30 january 1943 in the three months between 21 october 1942 and 21 january 1943 they had lost 540 of 983 troops fighting for the red october factory on 31 january 1943 general paulus announced the surrender of the german 6th army on 2 february the legion became soviet prisoners of war including all officers approximately 100 mostly wounded sick and frostbitten combat soldiers as well as some 600 other legionaries from artillery and support units in the two weeks leading up to the capitulation the 369th regiment had lost 175 soldiers the legion assembled at beketovka on river volga where they were joined by some 80 000 mainly german as well as italian romanian and hungarian pows they were sent on forced march to moscow where they were joined by croatian legionnaires from the light transport brigade who had been attached to italian forces on the eastern front from there they were sent to work camps in siberia many died on the march due to starvation hypothermia or disease regiment veterans more than 1000 legionnaires were evacuated from the soviet union and later stalingrad by various means and for various reasons they were awarded the croatian legion 1941 linden leaf for their service and formed the core of new unit the 369th croatian infantry division wehrmacht ndh stamp issued for 369th regiment aftermath further information german prisoners of war in the soviet union in late october 1944 the yugoslav legion numbering about 3 000 operated as part of the red army around čačak during the belgrade offensive this unit was formed in early 1944 partly from former members of the 369th croatian reinforced infantry regiment and was commanded by the former ustaše lieutenant colonel marko mesić assisted by captain milutin perišić serb both officers were praised by soviet general sergey biryuzov in the summer of 1943 one hundred legionaries and 6 officers including marko mesic were transferred to suzdalj and later to krasnogorsk near moscow where they met with most of the surviving croat soldiers at krasnogorsk the soviets formed new unit that utilized royal yugoslav uniforms at the time soviets did not recognize tito forces as sovereign state during early soviet imprisonment col mesić may have been forced to appear in soviet propaganda wearing royal yugoslav army uniform and tito flag to save the lives of his remaining men upon news of this the ministry of the armed forces removed him from the croatian armed forces and rescinded his awards col mesić was given command by the soviets of this newly formed first yugoslav volunteer brigade assembled from prisoners of war of yugoslavian origin as well as volunteers living in russia at the time it is quite likely that most former croatian soldiers of the 369 regiment chose communist partisan service to avoid almost certain death in soviet prisoner of war camps during the first few months in captivity legionnaire numbers were reduced from some 700 to around 400 odd survivors or 40 loss of life in under twelve months the new yugoslav partisan brigade now wearing old royal yugoslav army uniforms was commanded by experienced former 369th regiment croat legion officers like lt col egon zitnik the former commander of the light transport unit major marijan prislin the former second in command of the 369 regiment artillery section and major marijan tulicic the former artillery unit commander new unit military training was very fast as most men were experienced soldiers as late as march 1944 they were joined by 200 more former 369th legionaries led by former 369th stalingrad doctor bogoljub modrijan as well as lt vlahov lt tahtamišimov lt draženović and lt ivan vadlja who was wounded at stalingrad but missed the last flight out they were transported to yugoslavia in late 1944 under direct orders from tito where they were sacrificed in combat against superior german forces suffering very high casualties the few remaining survivors were suspected and most were later convicted of being soviet infiltrators by the partisans as well as

bhaktavatsalamdistributed bysanketrelease date 9 november 1984 1984 11 09 running time125 minutescountryindialanguagekannada accident is 1984 indian kannada language film directed by shankar nag the film starred his elder brother anant nag and wife arundhati nag in lead roles the film won the national film award for best film on other social issues at the 32nd national film awards in 1985 it also won multiple awards at the 1984 85 karnataka state film awards including the award for first best film it a milestone movie in the history of kannada cinema the film was praised for placing politician against justice system and media revealing the nexus between politics and drug mafia contents 1 cast 2 analysis 3 notes 4 plot 5 reception 6 awards 7 references 8 external links cast anant nag as politician dharmadhikari shankar nag as journalist ravi arundhati nag as rich widow maya rani ashok mandanna as deepak makeup naani as editor shamanna srinivas prabhu as rahul ramesh bhat as inspector rao s nagabharana as ramanna g somashekhara rao as mechanic pinto shimoga venkatesh as police commissioner analysis critics call it one of the first films depicting corruption in public life and the futile struggle against it the film also throws light on the unholy nexus between politicians and media whilst focusing on the impact of drug abuse and addiction contrary to stereotypes of indian cinema which include romantic interests intense background music and songs which are generally accompanied by dance sequences the movie takes neo noir approach towards investigative journalism which forms the bulk of the movie this can be considered one of the earliest approaches towards paradigm shift in film making in india which unfortunately didn take off until the early 2000s due to the tragic death of shankar nag in 1990 ilayaraja score is sombre which plays an important role in the film attuning to the grim nature of grief suffered by the lone survivor of the accident background noise such as clanking of typewriter keys camera clicks car screeches white television noise bullets sliding inside pistol etc form the bulk of the spacing in the movie the silence at the scene of the accident scene is haunting there are no songs in this movie which provides it far more serious pacing in comparison to the casual overtones found in most kannada movies distinction amongst different classes in society is well represented in the movie and the disdain powerful politicians have towards ordinary working class people whilst not campaigning for an election is wonderfully portrayed every movie directed by shankar nag is master piece it would be wise to remember that with malgudi days he does inhabit the heart of every indian not just kannadigas he is the director that in ways more than one represents direction which was not fully realized in india for quite sometime until independent film makers with the assistance of social media started to take things into their own creative control whether be it his revolutionary approach towards grand theft auto combined with prison break in minchina ota or his portrayal of everyday family life amongst the middle class in 1980 bengaluru as witnessed nodi swamy navirodu heege mr nag did not shy away from showcasing his versatility in directing at every opportunity presented to him notes shankar nag made the film in two months flat the political atmosphere of the country was in turmoil the sanctity of the golden temple in punjab had been desecrated the air was charged with helplessness anger and confusion while shooting climax of the film ananth nag who was playing the politician was to be shot in the courtyard of his house he originally wanted to work it around the assassination of indira gandhi shankar nag was dead sure that it had to be that way and changed ending of film plot deepak ashok mandanna the spoilt son of powerful politician dharmadhikari ananth nag runs his imported car over pavement dwellers one fateful night under the influence of drugs except for lone survivor all are killed ramanna nagabharana the survivor identifies the driver his friend rahul srinivasa prabhu son of an advertising agency chief arundhati nag is with him during the accident the shock of the accident leaves rahul deeply traumatised unable to hold keep the secret any longer rahul shares the truth with his mother she in turn implores to dharmadhikaari to save them dharmadhikari who is slated to win by election cannot afford to let this accident ruin his political ambitions he hushes up the case with the help of chief minister and sends his son on trip abroad inspector rao ramesh bhat is the investigating officer ravi shankar nag daring investigative journalist joins him and the duo begin to putting together the evidence with rao help ravi gets to the bottom of the whole affair when rao identifies the culprits dharmadhikari asks his retired driver to say he was driving the car rao is asked to go on leave and ravi editor refuses to run the story on his way to the airport deepak dies in an accident dharmadhikari wins but loses at the same time shankar nag apparently changed the climax he originally wanted to work it around the assassination of indira gandhi reception accident was well received by critics and audience the movie won the karnataka state film award accident is testimony to the exceptional directorial ability of shankar nag awards 32nd national film awards national film award for best film on other social issues karnataka state film awards 1984 85 first best

his death the bharipa bahujan mahasangha contested established political parties like indian national congress shiv sena and bharatiya janata party in the akola municipal elections emerging victorious the success was gained through the new social engineering brought by prakash ambedkar which later known as akola pattern the expansion of the party continued after 1995 that some of the non dalit parties and organisations have joined the bharipa bahujan mahasangh ambedkar was member of the rajya sabha during 1990 1996 he was elected in the 12th lok sabha elections from akola lok sabha

elections and he was member of the lok sabha till 2004 ambedkar followed policy on the one hand of regrouping the dalits and on the other of following moderate line seeking alliance with those opposition parties which sympathised with the dalit cause it was with their support that he twice contested elections to the parliament from non reserved constituencies though not successful in getting elected he polled sizeable number of votes on both the occasions the rpi organised march from nashik to mumbai to press its demands prominent among which was the transfer of vatan lands to their dalit cultivators both before and after the british raj certain lands were given to people for services rendered by them to the government or to the community or to both these lands are also called watan lands in local legislation and in maharashtra many of the watans were abolished between 1950 and 1960 in response the government appointed committee with prakash ambedkar as member the rpi greatest success was in 1988 when ambedkar in alliance with other dalit organisations took out massive demonstration in mumbai the occasion was the controversy regarding move to delete from the official publication of r ambedkar writings portion called riddles of hinduism the deletion move was supported by shiv sena which by this time was emerging as hindu political organisation to bring all dalit organisations together for this purpose prakash ambedkar formed ambedkar vichar samvardhak samiti avss under the leadership of prakash ambedkar s gavai and others on 5 february 1988 dalits put on massive show of strength which brought more than four to five lakh followers of r ambedkar into the heart of mumbai city from different parts of maharashtra and also from gujarat and other states within days of the dalit demonstration in mumbai the riddles issue was resolved at meeting on february 10 of representatives of the shiv sena the maratha mahasangh and the various groups of the republican party of india and the dalit panthers called by the state chief minister it was agreed at the meeting that the relevant appendix would be retained intact in the fourth volume of ambedkar works only line would be added to clarify that the maharashtra government did not agree or disagree with r ambedkar comments on the hindu gods bahujan mahasangh political formation working in close association with the bharatiya republican party led by prakash ambedkar was formed in february 1993 in the summer of that year its candidate won kinwat legislative assembly seat in nanded district defeating congress and bjp contestants the alliance between bharatiya republican party and bahujan mahasangh visualised joint front of dalits and obcs whose cultural identity was essentially non brahmin bahujan mahasangh argued that in the brahminical social order both dalits and obcs find themselves equally oppressed culturally bahujan mahasangh had defined the bahujan category to include buddhists sikhs jains and muslims as well as caste groups such as shudra obcs and ati shudra dalits tribes women poor marathas and poor brahmins thus including all those who are subjugated through caste class and gender exploitation in memory of mahar soldiers who fought in the battle of koregaon their descendants buddhists visit koregaon bhima on 1 january every year to honor them on 1 january 2018 buddhists as well as some hindu dalit obc and sikh people visited the jay sthambh victory pillar at koregaon bhima in pune district maharashtra prakash ambedkar accused sambhaji bhide and milind ekbote of seducing the invading hindutva people and demanded the police investigation and strict action against the two but the maharashtra government and the state police did not take any action against the culprits so on 3 january 2018 he called on the people of maharashtra to call maharashtra bandh this call to shut down maharashtra received huge response from the people and the bandh was success the bandh was seen across maharashtra including mumbai according to ambedkar more than 50 maharashtrian people participated in the bandh earlier only bal thackeray of shiv sena had the power to shut down mumbai subsequently prakash ambedkar political power increased he came to the center of ambedkarite and bahujan community the youth group in particular became his supporters prakash ambedkar founded new political party the vanchit bahujan aghadi on 20 march 2018 with its ideology primarily emphasizing constitutionalism ambedkarism secularism socialism and progressivism the vanchit bahujan aghadi registered as political party year later on 15 march 2019 prior to the 2019 elections for lok sabha it is supported by nearly 100 small political parties and social organizations prakash ambedkar is the supremo of the vanchit bahujan aghadi on 14 march 2019 ambedkar has announced the bharipa bahujan mahasangh will merge with the vanchit bahujan aghadi he said that despite the akola pattern of social engineering through the success of the bharipa bahujan mahasangh the word bharipa rpi had limited the expansion of the party he said that after the 2019 lok sabha elections the bharip bahujan mahasangh will merge with the vanchit bahujan aghadi because the vanchit bahujan aghadi is acceptable in broad sense ambedkar contested and lost from both akola and solapur in the 2019 lok sabha elections controversy prakash ambedkar courted controversy by asking his supporters to resort to troll against those who criticised his statement asking for proof on surgical strikes conducted by indian air force many critics called it militant dalit politics writings ambedkari chalval sampli ahe the ambedkarite movement has ended andheri nagari chaupat raja

minded associations and new journal the review of educational research began as reference work summarizing recent studies while early topics in review of educational research focused primarily on education psychology and administration the publication broadened its coverage in the mid 1930s in response to diversification in the field the role of education research in the progressive education

professional discourse as the field continued to advance much of the knowledge did not translate into practice an issue that is still widely debated today these divisions in the field made it difficult for education researchers to speak with one voice just prior to world war ii review of educational research made the case that because science could not speak to goals and choices education

anuszkiewicz who worked in paper mill his parents were polish immigrants anuszkiewicz trained at the cleveland institute of art in cleveland ohio 1948 1953 and then with josef albers at the yale university school of art in new haven connecticut 1953 1955 where he earned his masters of fine arts he was one of the founders and foremost exponents of op art movement during the late 1960s and early 1970s victor vasarely in france and bridget riley in england were his primary international counterparts in 1964 life magazine called him one of the new wizards of op while reflecting on new york city gallery show of anuszkiewicz from 2000 new york times art critic holland cotter described anuszkiewicz paintings the drama and that feels like the right word is in the subtle chemistry of complementary colors which makes the geometry glow as if light were leaking out from behind it anuszkiewicz exhibited at the venice biennale florence biennale and documenta and his works are in permanent collections internationally he was elected into the national academy of design in 1992 as an associate member and became full member in 1994 style considered major force in the op art movement anuszkiewicz was concerned with the optical changes that occur when different high intensity colors are applied to the same geometric configurations most of his work comprises visual investigations of formal structural and color effects many of them nested square forms similar to the work of his mentor josef albers in his series homage to the square albers experimented with juxtapositions of color and anuszkiewicz developed these concepts further anuszkiewicz continued to produce works in the op art style over the subsequent decades of his career in 1963 anuszkiewicz summarized his approach to painting as my work is of an experimental nature and has centered on an investigation into the effects of complementary colors of full intensity when juxtaposed and the optical changes that occur as result and study of the dynamic effect of the whole under changing conditions of light and the effect of light on color selected collections holding works albright knox

application defined network adn is an enterprise data network that uses virtual network and security components to provide dedicated logical network for each application with customized security and network policies to meet the requirements of that specific application adn technology allows for simple physical architecture with fewer devices less device configuration and integration reduced network administration and lower tax on it resources adn solutions simplify businesses need to securely deploy multiple applications across the enterprise footprint and partner networks regardless of where the application resides adn platforms provide policy based application specific delivery to corporate data centers cloud services and or third party networks securely and cost effectively some adn solutions integrate 3g 4g wireless backup services to enable second internet connection automatically and instantly when connectivity is lost on the primary access connection the adn design provides an application to application a2a based model that evolves enterprise networks beyond the site to site s2s private model contents 1 adn fundamentals 1 1 a2a 2 security 3 references adn fundamentals adn solutions address the need to enable multiple different applications such as guest wifi hotspot while strictly securing regulated applications such as payment on the same network traditionally in site to site networks having multiple applications introduces significant security policy conflicts technologies such as guest wi fi mobile payment and or cloud services open the traditional private network to outside security threats and create significant complexity in security policies and network administration adns can be customized with specific security features that address specific application needs and enhanced with performance and reliability features such as traffic management for application prioritization and fail over for back up connection services complexity breeds vulnerability application defined networks adns significantly reduce complexity and the resulting costs of multiple device investment and management configuration integration and problem isolation and resolution adns are typically enabled on secure appliance at the distributed enterprise locations that integrate with cloud network to connect applications to corporate data centers cloud services payment gateways and partner networks adns eliminate the potential for route conflicts security cascade across applications and problem cascade caused by one application misbehaving and affecting other applications on the same network route conflicts traditional site to site networks facilitate multiple applications over single connections ex vpns mpls vpns and ethernet and require complex security rules to partition applications from one another simple errors in device configurations can create routing problems that can breach strict security and compliance based applications such as pci dss and hipaa certifications the ability to completely segment these applications into their own discrete adn removes that complexity of managing multiple security partitions across many locations security cascade traditional site to site networks are subject to security bleed when network segment that is open to the internet gets breached advanced persistent threats apts are becoming more frequent effective and damaging the damage is occurring when the threat roots inside the breached segment and stealthily probes entry points into other network segments several security breaches have been the result of this security cascade where vulnerability between network segments is exploited adns eliminate the ability for security breach to cascade between network segments and applications by compartmentalizing applications into secure and isolated networks problem cascade on traditional site to site network when specific problem in an individual application configuration results in abnormal behaviors the problem ends up affecting all other applications on the network essentially one application misbehaving results in all applications being affected and the entire network being compromised isolating the root of the problem becomes extremely difficult and time consuming when network is in chaos or completely down on an application defined network problems are isolated to the specific application network allowing for simpler fault isolation and resolution adns are logically defined virtual networks that extend from application enabler to application gateways adn solutions combine the ability to define specific lan segments with an actual adn this provides the ability to extend the adn through the lan to specific interface on the application enabler pos system server etc an assigned zone will lock down specific lan port to specific use for example serial port 1 would be assigned to the payment adn lan segment only and no other devices can use that specific lan port and if unauthorized device is plugged into zone 1 it will not work this provides both physical and logical security protections against unauthorized use of port the adn then facilitates the connection from the specific lan port over the public broadband connection independently of any public ip addressing the adn is then authenticated inside the cloud and transported to the destination application gateway this provides an end to end application enabler to an application gateway network that is independently defined both physically and logically the application gateway can reside within the corporate office or data centers cloud service providers partner networks or virtually anywhere a2a application to application a2a networks remove site to site s2s limitations by defining the network architecture at the application level a2a networks open the enterprise network to be able to securely connect to any application no matter where it resides a2a networks free the enterprise network from burdensome controls and restricted hub and spoke traffic patterns by facilitating any to any traffic pattern based on the specific needs to the application itself companies no longer have to overspend by purchasing application licenses and building the application within their data centers and incur all the associated capital network and it resource costs a2a networking allows companies to implement innovation and efficiently deploy multiple applications using cloud services that address needs such as improved customer value operational efficiencies and product differentiation security adn network simplifies security by establishing discrete independent networks that do not require complex security rules to partition traffic types adns reduce the risk of human error in maintaining complex access control lists acls across many sites which can create security vulnerabilities for example if an adn with public internet access is breached by an outside party the ability of the breach to bleed between adns such as payment adn is eliminated adn standard security features include firewall intrusion detection logging wireless scanning content filtering access control list multi factor authentication advanced encryption standard aes encryption and compartmentalization additional custom security features can also be easily

aquademics was michigan nonprofit organization established in 1990 to increase the number and presence of african american children in competitive water sports in addition to sponsoring competitive swimming team aquademics operated an academic support program based in ann arbor aquademics programs were open to all youth of color children ages seven to sixteen living in washtenaw county in operation throughout the 1990s aquademics formally disbanded at the turn of the 21st century the aquademics model resembled other athletics programs created in the late 1980s and 1990s whose goal was to increase youth of color participation in sports lacking in diversity and with history of racial exclusion the aquademics program was also guided by the precedent that sporting excellence is means to teach children other forms of excellence most importantly academic excellence the aquademics model impact can be measured by the number of former members currently in professions where credentials and opportunities require associate and college degrees aquademics alums are represented in the following professions business communications nonprofit administration computer science law and the military including the s marine corps and the s navy moreover few aquademics alums and former staff have volunteered or are working in water sport professions two head coaches who started their water sport coaching with aquademics continued with their coaching careers aquademics original coach vicki hames frazier was water sports instructor of children with special needs for the washtenaw intermediate school district after aquademics hames frazier became head coach of the co ed swimming team at ann arbor greenhills school she is one of the first african american women to coach high

team met with former colleague wilma allen then assistant director research services at cpha national health information services firm delay was interested in starting swimming program for underserved kids whose access to swimming had been impeded by discrimination inadequate resources and lack of coaching mentors cognizant and supportive of appeals for educational reform in athletics voiced at the time by tennis champion humanitarian and activist arthur ashe allen and delay also committed the endeavor to strong academic program they were joined in forming aquademics by three other educators and health care professionals to comprise the founding board carmel borders adjunct faculty member in health education at eastern michigan university melvin rhoden admissions director of ann arbor greenhills school and health company executive gloria jackson aquademics name merged its two vital goals aqua tics and aca demics the motto served its mission swimmers make better learners the logo featured its goal black swimmer smoothly churning through large waves the southeastern michigan competitive swimming culture and community southeastern michigan is long established training site for competitive swimmers and well recognized in the competitive swimming world it boasts top ranked championship and highly respected college teams among them the university of michigan oakland university and eastern michigan university likewise club programs such as the ann arbor swim club and club wolverine include on their annual rosters several regionally and nationally ranked swimmers school programs such as the ann arbor pioneer high school boys and girls swimming and diving teams have won over thirty state championships since 1977 several southeastern michigan water sport coaches are highly regarded and swimmers come from across the nation and around the world to train and compete on the region college teams aquademics depended on the good will and generous support of this talent and resource rich experienced and close knit swimming culture and community learning from history equally important aquademics learned from the enterprise of pioneers in african american swimming history who had established swimming programs in detroit knowledge about african americans and their place in swimming history has been burdened by racism and obstructed by persistent and inaccurate stereotypes water sports in america and the architecture of both private and public swimming pools represented landscape set up for racial inequality and segregation during the new deal in the 1930s the construction of public pools expanded reasons and some opportunities for all ethnic and racial groups to learn how to swim nevertheless blacks were prohibited from whites only facilities as result several communities with large numbers of african american citizens supported their own water sport recreation centers one of the most visible in southeastern michigan was the lucy thurman ywca the accomplishments of those who participated in the lucy thurman ywca swimming programs in the first half of the 20th century are especially noteworthy by the 1990s when aquademics swimmers jumped into the pool the most pernicious structures of discrimination faced by blacks in water sports had been dismantled evidence of these changes was affirmed by the fast times clocked by an upcoming generation of accomplished african american swimmers trained under the farsighted leadership of jim ellis head coach of the philadelphia department of recreation known in swimming circles as pdr further number of metropolitan swim teams with majority of african american swimmers were expanding their reach into urban communities and sending their record breaking and qualifying time swimmers to state national and international events among them were teams from atlanta detroit baltimore st louis washington dc aquademics in the water the ann arbor ymca was aquademics first pool the founding team included four girls and two boys ranging in age from nine to fourteen when the aquademics team became too big for one lane instruction the team obtained practice time at the eastern michigan university emu pool through the good offices of the emu women swimming coach this was temporary solution however given the demands and expenses of training at university facility by 1993 aquademics moved into its home pool at clague middle school the aquademics team decided on team colors of black and gold after the group purchased its first practice fins swimming lessons training and competitions with other local clubs followed by 1993 the aquademicsmobile donated van took aquademics swimmers all over southeastern michigan accompanied by caravan of family and friend supporters rival teams included university liggett school ypsilanti otters detroit northside seacolts and the detroit recreational center aquademics was honored with the 1994 award for its service to community youth by the friends of the o e brien center for youth development group offering wide range of treatment and counselling services to young people in washtenaw county few months before receiving this award in february 1994 the aquademics team and families travelled to and competed in the black history invitational then in its eighth year the bhi hosted by the washington dc department of parks and recreation is the premier gathering of competitive african american swimmers in the nation the aquademics team participated in five black history invitationals in 1999 inspired by the success of the bhi aquademics hosted smaller competition the kwanzaa invitational it was held from december 17 19 1999 at the university of michigan canham natatorium and included teams from around the region swimmers make better learners scholastic achievement was central to aquademics to fulfill its mission three initiatives were supported the program established an annual camp the aquademics camp was at once water sport clinic cultural experience and summer school in addition to the swimming practices and training common to all sport camps the fundamental skills of other water sports such as water polo water skiing and scuba diving were introduced campers took field trips to several african american history and cultural institutions the charles wright museum of african american history the black madonna bookstore and the african art collections at the detroit institute of art in 1993 campers met with several lucy thurman ywca alumna who provided cultural history lesson about their experiences as synchronized swimmers in the 1930s and 1940s finally the camp incorporated study skill and time management instruction learning style discussions and offered tutorials in specific subjects college scholarship fund was launched to provide financial assistance to aquademics members with stellar academic records during high school funded by former health care researcher linda sprankle an advocate of programs committed to youth of color the sprankle scholarship became synonymous with high academic achievement and for aquademics members an honor as competitive and prestigious as getting medals in swimming the group engaged betty springfield volunteer program director to sustain an effective academic program she joined the founding board to lend expertise for two ends to strengthen the academic support and counselling programs and to shift the program toward family centered leadership in 1995 springfield increased and expanded the academic counselling staff instituted after practice tutorials and secured flexible partnership with another academic group associated with the ann arbor public schools the african american academy then in 1996 the founding board approved plan to transfer governing authority to parents and families of aquademics members to the swimmers make better learners motto another watchword was embraced always remember that the children are in the water this expression called to mind the power of water and charged everyone affiliated with aquademics to advance the promise and well being of children and to promote life skills that keep children out of harm way family centered leadership the transfer to family centered board in 1997 meant that the founders and nurturers of the organization turned governance over to the sustainers and legacy builders of aquademics the shift had the immediate effect of increasing the number of children belonging to the program over the next two years the group concentrated on educating area youth groups and on increasing awareness of aquademics mission to community leaders in 1999 aquademics was given community recognition award for outstanding service by an organization by the trustees of washtenaw community college challenges aquademics was grass roots nonprofit organization as result the group obtained resources through several approaches and maintained its programs by relying on combination of grants business sponsorships fund raisers annual giving and in kind donations critical seed grants were awarded by the ann arbor area community foundation and the southeastern michigan community foundation original corporate sponsors included two local banks in kind donations came from range of sources from swimming kickboards to donated coaching expertise the programs however were not free each family contributed to the funding of camp and was assessed participation fee every season fund raising was all consuming and required major time commitments by families and volunteers who worked with aquademics scaling up the program to provide financial security and stable source of income proved increasingly difficult with no endowment the organization had to survive from season to season likewise the advantage of being in an area with abundant swimming resources also meant that aquademics as development or bridge program encountered some turnover to other clubs whose goals did not require academics and cultural components because of all of these challenges the board of aquademics determined to end operations at the beginning of the 21st century legacy the history of aquademics is emblematic of the success and obstacles that confront individuals and groups whose purposes are to diversify the face of an exclusive sport and to transform sport establishment that has been neither welcoming nor accessible to large numbers of people because of discrimination swimming may have more to answer for swimming pools and beaches for water sport recreation were symbols of segregation they became contested sites during the civil rights movement in the 1960s but at the same time the wade ins and brave calls to come on in and swim encouraged and strengthened the african american swimming movement today it is no longer as uncommon to see african americans at the elite levels of swimming and other water sports over the last two decades several elite african american swimmers have not only broken american records but have displayed their willingness to be mentors to new generation of black swimmers soon after cullen jones an african american freestyler became the first african american to hold or share world record in swimming at the beijing olympics in 2008 he described his hopes that he would work to increase the number of african american children in swimming as result of these promising changes it might be said that programs like aquademics are no longer important or that it is not surprising program like aquademics has disbanded because it is no longer necessary but lost and ignored knowledge about the heritage of african americans in swimming and its importance as life skill have taken toll and create perilous cultural undercurrent that continues to have fatal consequences alarmingly over half of african americans do not know how to swim today their encounters with water are therefore more likely to be life threatening the tragic statistics reveal that they are african american children ages 10 to 14 drown at five times the rate of other ethnic and racial groups in the united states fortunately today other organizations are advancing the legacy of aquademics and programs similar to it and simultaneously they are rediscovering and reclaiming lost knowledge and heritage as well as documenting the reality that black children always were have been and always will be in the water see also 1 black history invitational 2 black splash exhibit at the international swimming hall of fame 3 black swimming history 4

pontiac township high school and flanagan illinois high school and eureka college he held number of different jobs over the years while still in his twenties attig retired the first time to carry out record setting voyage in power cruiser which he designed and built using it he became the first man from the area to make water journey from seneca illinois on the illinois river to new orleans the terminus of the mississippi river from new orleans he moved around the gulf coast eventually crossing the gulf of mexico to st petersburg florida and cruised for period on the yacht attig schooner under full sail donald attig established three sets of world class benchmark records in the adventure and endurance challenge categories in the late sixties he developed system for assembly line production of panelized all molded homes attig also created research foundation which he funded from his own resources toward the international benchmark records in 1968 by permission of the honorable brian kelly he became the first person to build 3 mast sailing ship from the keel up in the us under the irish flag for ten years attig and his family lived and voyaged on the 3 mast sailing ship attig skippered the vessel over 5 000 miles on rivers and the inland waterways system before putting out to sea during this 5 000 mile voyage on inland waterways attig developed and honed the skills which decades later would carry him through the world class benchmark record establishing efforts attig sailed with his wife and new born son to ireland in 1977 and traveled to many other places two of his five children omar brendan and john paul were born on the vessel for years attig and his son omar operated free sailing excursions on the schooner for at risk youth with children of any religion from northern ireland during the troubles and others in need after his eldest son omar who had been born on the ship was involved in fatal car crash attig turned the ship over to the vec youth reach program benchmark records in his seventies between the ages of 71 and 73 he was involved in establishing international benchmark records in the fields of endurance challenge and adventure challenge in 2007 he organized and co crewed in the first transit of the shannon navigation and beyond to the seaport of tarbert county kerry in live aboard boat without an engine experienced boaters who understood the hazards involved in such project thought it impossible the river shannon is the longest river in ireland in 2008 he traveled the entire shannon navigation and beyond to the seaport of foynes county limerick using the same live aboard boat without an engine in 2008 he was the first person to transit the entire river erne navigation in live aboard boat without an engine these three distinct and different world class benchmark establishing record efforts when combined involved moving over one ton of live aboard boat and gear over 600 miles almost 1 000 kilometers without an engine most of the distance was accomplished by rowing additional benchmark records he established include the total of miles transited in the combined efforts total of 600 miles 960 kilometers over the bottom in the three contiguous years in an engineless live aboard boat also each record benchmark established over the three years has the additional claim of having person over 70 involved in its establishment shannon benchmark records the engineless transit from the start of the shannon navigation at the inishmagrath marker on lough allen in county leitrim to the end of shannon navigation at killaloe county clare and beyond to the port of tarbot in the sea estuary required dealing with 33 bridges 6 locks and nine lakes without mechanical power one of the locks ardnacrusha has descent of over 100 feet 30 guides warn boaters using large full powered cruisers to only cross the larger lakes in company the very strong flow through many of the bridges often throws full powered boats out of control causing them to smash into the bridge piers for example the water flow through killaloe bridge can be 600 to 700 tonnes per second this hazard of losing control in or approaching bridges can result in major damage and an occasional sinking each of the 4 turbines at the ardnacrusha power station which is running dumps 100 tons of water per second into the narrow constricted tail race this maelstrom must be negotiated for the transit to the estuary powerboats are advised to remain in the center of the tail race and maintain high power the prevailing wind is from the south west and funnels up the shannon channel this is great impediment to an un powered cabin boat proceeding down stream 2007 benchmark berths for family enclosed toilet room cast iron heating stove not your standard rowboat during the 2007 record establishing effort jack donovan of ballincollig co cork who was 60 at the time and had been living with full blown multiple sclerosis for over 2 decades and donnacha rowed well over 90 of the time most of that was in zig zag pattern due to the wind resistance of the large topside area and almost flat box type bow of the one ton plus of live aboard boat and gear when they reached tarbert their satellite navigation device indicated that the pair had traveled more than 268 miles 431 km shannon navigation attempt donald attig and jack donovan started their benchmark establishing effort on june 29 2007 at cormongan beach on lough allen at 10 m they rowed from that spot to the inismagrath end of navigation marker at the top of lough allen to begin the first ever attempt to make an engineless transit of the shannon in boat equipped with live aboard accommodations mr stephan haeni swiss national living at cleighran more witnessed their arrival and departure at the inismagrath marker they completed the shannon navigation on saturday july 28 2007 entering the killaloe canal at 4 20 m at that point the official shannon navigation had been transited in and engineless live aboard boat beyond the shannon navigation the irish coast guard attempted to dissuade the pair from continuing on past the end of navigation marker at the killaloe bridge jack and donald left the killaloe canal at 4 20 m on july 28 2007 they dropped anchor in the bay of the sea port of tarbert county kerry at 8 m on august 8 establishing the final benchmark records of their effort senior citizens jack donovan and donald attig were the first crew to transit the entire river shannon navigation and beyond in an engineless boat with full live aboard capability their record setting efforts were carried out during the wettest summer on the shannon since 1947 and 48 the vessel and gear which they used in the benchmark record establishing effort weighed over one ton 2008 single handed feat donald attig established more adventure challenge and endurance challenge records by making the same basic trip single handed in the same vessel omar river bird rté nationwide produced segment about shannon challenge 2008 which aired june 6 2008 at 1 30 m june 26 donald attig started at cormongan beach on lough allen in county leitrim he was driven back by the wind and had to anchor 30 metres 98 ft from the beach it was over two days before he could lift anchor and start for the marker at inismagrath at 12 05 m on august 16 2008 he reached the seaport of foynes 2009 more benchmark records belleek and the finish of 960 kilometers 600 miles without an engine in 3 years donald attig became the first person to complete the entire river erne navigation single handed in an engineless live aboard boat he used the same boat for this effort as was used in 2007 and 2008 there are enough hazards on the erne navigation to make passage in an engineless boat large enough to be live aboard world class challenge the northern ireland tourist site warns that upper lough erne is shallow maze and that waves on lower lough erne can reach open sea dimensions violent wind shears from the cliffs of mago can create grave difficulties for full powered cruisers at any time all this combines to create formidable challenge for an engineless boat that has the windage connected with live aboard accommodations this benchmark record establishing effort started at belturbet co cavan august 6 at 6 30 m it was attended by number of dignitaries the effort was completed sunday august 30 at 7 45 m at the public dock in belleek county fermanagh efforts witnessed and supported all three of the above benchmark establishing efforts were witnessed by thousands of persons and recorded at length in the media and press the members of the inland waterways association of ireland supported followed and chronicled the efforts in 2007 the lough derg branch of iwai awarded the boat and crew honorary membership in their annual lough derg rally in the same year the iwai cruising club formally welcomed the boat into foynes harbor as it returned after completing the benchmark establishing efforts at tarbert the club also made the crew and boat officially part of the 2007 killaloe to killrush cruise in company fabricated housing installing roof on panelized plastic house from 1968 to 1971 attig developed the world first all molded conventional appearing housing system attig designed the system and produced the first small panels in his plastic company located on route 66 at pontiac illinois he then produced full sized molds and directed production of the prototype in the dura plex industries plant located in herrin illinois this received

vivian bales married name faison january 1909 december 2001 was the first motorcycle cover girl and was known for several long distance motorcycle rides around the us and motorcycle stunt riding in the 1920s and 1930s bales was born in florida in and raised in georgia after leaving school she worked as seamstress and dance instructor and in 1926 bought her first motorcycle new harley davidson model she taught herself to ride on this motorcycle and took her first long tour of 300 miles with female friend from her home in albany georgia to st petersburg florida florida the model was 350 cc single cylinder side valve with manually shifted three speed engine with battery and not magneto ignition and fully floating seat it was brought out to compete with the successful indian prince model and was called the peashooter for the sound of its exhaust one of the first streamline models it sold for around 235 florida harley davidson dealer heard the adventure leading to feature about it in the st petersburg florida newspaper and then in the atlanta journal bales planning longer journeys traded in her model for 1929 flathead engine series harley davidson first 45 cu in 740 cc motorcycle she wrote to hap jameson then editor of the harley davidson enthusiast magazine telling him about her plans to make longer solo trip the enthusiast motorcycle magazine was first published in 1916 13 years after the first harley davidson motorcycles built despite bales only being 5 feet 2 inches and 95 pounds and unable to kickstart the bike on her own jameson appointed bales as the official goodwill enthusiast girl and while harley davidson did not finance her journey arrangements were made for harley davidson dealers rotary clubs and others on the route to provide accommodation fuel and maintenance having only been riding for 3 years and aged 20 years old bales started on 1 june 1929 taking 78 days to cover about 5 000 miles alone from albany georgia to the harley davidson factory in milwaukee on the way back she traveled through canada manhattan the carolinas and washington c in washington senator william harris arranged for her to meet president herbert hoover wearing her trademark all white riding breeches shirt helmet socks and sweater with the enthusiast girl across its chest on the way as goodwill ambassador she met many local dignitaries bales became the first motorcycle magazine cover girl on the may and november 1929 editions and her journeys were well documented in the december 1929 issue and by local papers all over the usa she later became stunt rider at motorcycle races in tallahassee florida at her 23 december 2001 funeral aged 92 she was honored by procession of harley davidsons to arthur davidson she was the georgia peach for bales the motorcycle was key to the whole united states her adventurous spirit reacted against the received wisdom of the day that no woman should ride one she married william faison and adopted 3 children her

originbelgiumusedressageshow jumpingthree day eventingtraitsdistinguishing featureswarmblood sport horsebreed standardsbwp north american districtequus ferus caballus the belgian warmblood dutch belgisch warmbloedpaard is belgian breed of warmblood sport horse it is bred for dressage for show jumping and for three day eventing 164 it is one of three belgian warmblood breeds or stud books the others being the zangersheide and the belgian sport horse to which it is closely similar contents 1 history 2 breed characteristics 3 use 4 references history horse breeders in the netherlands germany and france had been producing elegant saddle horses for hundreds of years however because the belgian government was concerned about protecting the bloodlines of the brabant belgian draft horse it was not until the 1950s that breeders in belgium were allowed to breed lighter saddle horses the foundation stock of the belgian warmblood included jumping horses from france and the netherlands as well as hanoverians and holsteiners from germany the first stallion show for riding horses in belgium took place illegally in 1953 the bwp was founded in 1955 without native riding horses or all purpose heavy warmbloods belgian breeders had to import stallions and mares over the course of 50 years the bwp accrued mare base of over 3 500 broodmares and produced significant number of international quality show jumpers in 2010 the bwp was ranked 4th in the fei wbfsh international show jumping standings below only the kwpn dutch warmblood selle français and holsteiner studbooks breed characteristics as warmblood horse the belgian warmblood is characterized not by uniformity of coat color appearance or pedigree chart but by uniformity of purpose like other warmbloods belgian warmblood breeding horses are subjected to rigorous studbook selection the studbook brand which features pinwheel of horse heads is given to all belgian warmbloods the most reliable way to positively identify belgian warmblood is by the brand on the left thigh belgian warmblood foals receive this brand during their foal inspection when they are given passport and deemed free of obvious defects between the ages of three and four years old belgian warmblood stallions are presented to jury in hengstenkeuring or stallion licensing test the licensing test consists of veterinary inspection subjective evaluation of the stallion conformation and jumping ability without rider and evaluation of the stallion qualities under saddle stallions that do not achieve the desired marks in the licensing test are not eligible for the studbook to retain status in the studbook stallions must participate in competitions for young show jumping horses called the classic cycle mares take part in similar conformational evaluations however judgement of mare qualities as riding horse are elective belgian warmbloods range in size and substance but the ideal size for stallion is between 16 and 17 hands high at the withers mares are not eligible for breeding rights unless they exceed 15 1 hands high in type the belgian warmblood is similar to the holsteiner selle français dutch warmblood and hanoverian and less like the trakehner use denis lynch and nabab son dublin horse show 2008 over the past 20 years research has supported observations regarding the high heritability of jumping

was defeated by mahasenagupta his son supratisthitavarman came to power who built kamarupa elephant army but died prematurely without an heir thus the younger son bhaskaravarman came to power in kamarupa even after he succeeded to the throne 600 ce bhaskaravarman was known as kumara prince probably because he was bachelor throughout his life rivals mahasenagupta in alliance with shashanka had defeated on susthitavarman and took control over north and central bengal after the death of mahasenagupta shashanka became the ruler of this portion on ascending the throne bhaskaravarman found two strong rival powers growing in northern india viz one in central and northern bengal under shashanka and the other in mid india under prabhakaravardhana the father of harshavardhana when shashanka murdered rajyavardhana who had succeeded prabhakaravardhana as the king at thaneswar bhaskaravarman sent an envoy hangsavega to form an alliance this incident by both bana and xuanzang alliance with

invitation noting the king patronised buddhism though non buddhist according to the text of the si yu ki the circumference of the capital of kamarupa was thirty li and the king who was bhaskaravarman brahman by caste xuanzang translated into sanskrit the taoist text daodejing at the request of bhaskar varman kamarupa of bhaskaravarman xuanzang in his travelogue noted that he crossed great river karatoya before entering the kamarupa the eastern boundary was line of hills close to the chinese frontier he also said kamarupa was nearly 1700 miles in circumference the climate was genial he mentioned that the people were are short height and of yellow complexion and bhaskar varman was hindu and not buddhist the people were honest their speech differed little from that of mid india they were of violent disposition but were persevering students they worshipped the devas and did not believe in buddhism the deva temples were some hundreds in number and the various systems had some myriads of professed adherents the few buddhists in the country performed their acts of devotion in secret the pilgrim ascertained from the people that to the east of the country was series of hills which reached as far as the confines of china the inhabitants of these hills were akin to the man of the lao in the south east of the country elephants were plentiful description xuanzang notes that kamarupa was low and moist and that the crops were regular cocoa nuts and jackfruits grew abundantly and were appreciated by the people the description provided is around the present day guwahati according to the account given in the si yu ki the circumference of kamarupa was about 1 700 miles 2 700 km as edward albert gait has pointed out this circumference must have included the whole of the assam valley surma valley parts of north bengal and parts of mymensingh religion bhaskaravarman was worshiper of shiva though he had great reverence for learned buddhist priests and professors of his time and was distinctly inclined towards buddhism the general populace worshiped the devas worshiped in many temples and adherents of buddhism practised devotion secretly culture according to xuanzang the people of kamarupa were honest albeit with violent disposition but were persevering students the people were are short in height and of yellow complexion their speech differed from that of mid india the nidhanpur grant issued from karnasuvarna contained local literary forms and offices not found in subsequent kamarupa inscriptions art and industry the gifts from bhaskaravarman to harshavardhana contained mostly products of the land royal umbrella of exquisite workmanship studded with valuable gems puthis written on sachi bark dyed cane mats agar essence musk in silk bags liquid molasses in earthen pots utensils paintings pair of brahmini ducks in cage made of cane and overlaid with gold and considerable quantity of silk fabrics indicating industry was rudimentary nidhanpur inscription nidhanpur inscription of bhaskaravarman main article nidhanpur copperplate inscription bhaskaravarman praises himself in his nidhanpur copper plate inscription saying that he has revealed the light of the arya religion by dispelling the accumulated darkness of kali age by making judicious application of his revenues who has equalled the prowess of the whole ring of his feudatories by the strength of his own arm who has derived many way of enjoyment for his hereditary subjects whose loyal devotion to him was augmented by his steadiness modesty and affability who is adorned with wonderful ornament of splendid fame made of the flowery words of praise variously composed by hundreds of kings vanquished by him in battle whose virtuous activities like those of sivi were applied in making gifts for the benefit of others whose powers as of second preceptor of the gods brihaspati was recognised by others on account of his skill in devising and applying the means of politics that appear in suitable moments whose own conduct was adorned by learning valour patience prowess and good actions nalanda seal the nalanda seal of bhaskaravarman dated 643 bhaskaravarman close connection with harsha and xuanzang led to his association with the famous buddhist university of magadha for his seal has been discovered at the site of nalanda in the company of two

inviting xuanzang as however it was found in the company of the two harsha seals the probability is that both harsha and bhaskaravarman on their march from rajmahal to kanauj visited nalanda together with the chinese pilgrim and to commemorate their visit left their respective seals at the university death it is not known how or when bhaskaravarman died but it is estimated that his reigned ended

absorbed number of influences for instance s bach chopin debussy ross lee finney the variety of styles in boury piano pieces reveal music history itself in that they connect to the music of an earlier age such as renaissance and baroque eras to romantic and contemporary eras this characteristic is crucial to the understanding and appreciation of boury style compositions and is in need of research and analysis for those who desire to explore boury piano works contents 1 life 1 1 biographical background 1 2 teachers and influences 1 3 musical career 2 compositions 2 1 piano 2 2 vocal 2 3 choral

michael boury and uncles operated the elby restaurant chain michael managing the commissary while boury mother pearl mickey was stay at home mother he describes his father as the master of money and business and narrates that his father was always bringing home new food recipes to try out on boury mother and sister he remembers his mother as good pianist with wonderful touch in her piano playing however she turned down full scholarship to the cincinnati conservatory to get married even though she chose to be wife and mother she kept playing the piano for boury and his sister every day he describes her sound as follows my mother had the most beautiful touch of anyone ve ever heard up close she only taught me by example ve been trying to recreate it ever since boury was influenced by his mother beautiful piano playing and later began his piano study at age ten with dorothy ackerman zoeckler she was student of robert goldsand at the manhattan school of music who was also an author published composer and member of the national league of american pen women she recognized boury talent in music and encouraged him to explore not just music but also poetry and art boury took piano lessons and composition lessons from ackerman for seven years he talks about memories of his early musical study with her she had books on art and literature that we her students could take home would go to her house every day after school and sight read downstairs where parents and students waited for their lesson hoping for cancellation so could have an extra lesson she sensed that my brain was growing faster than my technique so she gave me set of rossini overtures conducted on 78s by arturo toscanni had no idea there was such beauty in the world the music was poignant and funny traits would continue to cherish in music determined that day not to become performer of such music but rather to compose music like that teachers and influences in 1964 boury continued further music education at manhattan school of music where he studied with david diamond in the junior level composition class boury still remembers what diamond said in the class you can write anything you want so long as it a fugue david diamond born 1915 died 2005 studied composition with bernard rogers and roger sessions he met maurice ravel in 1928 and took ravel suggestion to study with nadia boulanger who taught diamond counterpoint predominantly in 1937 diamond had an opportunity to receive tutorial instruction from stravinsky in paris diamond works are characterized as complex polyphonic approach with strong rhythmic pattern and seemingly innate formal logic boury followed diamond instructions during his study with him and wrote song cycle which contains three movements in fugal style diamond believed that counterpoint study would make music pour out of his students after that work was done when boury was in his senior year at manhattan school of music he enrolled in private lessons with mario davidovsky mario davidovsky came originally from argentina and immigrated to the united states davidovsky composition study began at age thirteen under guillermo graetzer and later with aaron copland who was not interested in electronic music despite copland preference to the contrary davidovsky continued composing electronic music with milton babbitt encouragement davidovsky specialized in live electronic mixtures in which he explored the possibilities of dialogues between taped music and various performing forces ranging from single instrument to full orchestra and chorus boury respected davidovsky musical style and him as great pedagogue as result boury took davidovsky advice to apply to the university of michigan for graduate school born in minnesota state ross lee finney born 1906 died 1997 was another teacher who also influenced boury while he was at the university of michigan finney was exposed to piano and cello at young age and by age twelve he was performing in small communities in the midwest he studied with nadia boulanger edward burlingame hill alban berg and roger sessions his style has wide range from romantic style twelve tone american midwestern roots to complex serial techniques in the fall of 1968 boury enrolled in the school of music at the university of michigan for his graduate degree he mentions that he was influenced great deal by just being around finney and his second viennese school works the inspiration led boury to compose an orchestra piece summer music 1968 which amazed his music theory teacher richmond browne who asked boury how he could know so much about vienna in 1935 while boury was graduate student at the university of michigan he also received instruction from leslie bassett who studied with arthur honegger member of les six bassett also studied roberto gerhard mario davidovsky ross lee finney and nadia boulanger many of bassett works are very short ranging from two minutes to twenty eight minutes they are clearly constructed and convey strong spiritual content bassett used conventional pitch materials within his unique manner bassett taught composition seminar and private composition courses at the graduate level at the university of michigan boury describes the time studying with bassett as follows mr bassett was and is master orchestral thinker my lessons with him were largely quiet affairs him looking for about half an hour at page of 30 line full score then saying aren the trombones little high seemed like nothing was happening yet look at my own instrumental music and have to say it looks like bassett very clean not many doublings bassett remembers boury as good man and an interesting composer dedicated to music and working hard musical career boury served as teaching fellow at university of michigan while he was pursuing his doctor of musical arts degree m after boury graduated from the university of michigan he took break from teaching and moved to indianapolis there he worked in sixteen track studio called tape masters as jingle writer as well as documentary film scores writer he later held job at capitol records in los angeles to produce lead sheets song transcriptions before returning to his hometown in wheeling west virginia to open piano composition studio in 1977 boury moved to lansing michigan after lansing community college invited him to create new music program for an associate degree this new degree program consisted of pop rock bands pop rock voice pop rock keyboard and pop rock guitar business in music along with boury courses three levels of pop rock theory and songwriting courses this new degree program attracted nationwide attention and enhanced enrollment at lansing community college boury mentioned that the experience at lansing community college changed his life tremendously as well as the career opportunity that led him to be at the current position at the university of arkansas at little rock boury joined university of arkansas in 1981 as resident composer and professor of music theory and composition he teaches courses such as analyses songwriting as well as private sessions which he enjoys boury also hosts songwriters showcase for his students every semester he believes that this event is great opportunity for his students to present their works as composers students are asked to find other musicians to perform in the event rather than playing their own composition projects when boury was asked for the reason he said that those students are all composers and should attend as composer not as performer later when the author requested to know about his philosophy of teaching boury said friend of mine challenged me to create philosophy of teaching in six words mine is m composer so are you boury devotion toward teaching and being resident composer can be seen just by talking to him boury says that he loves to teach and explains the teaching philosophy is my message whether children adults hospital patients university students bother general education students and music majors and minors compositions piano boury comments that he was in love with his first instrument piano by age thirteen although his

tim toyama had already shown an interest in the interaction between japanese americans and african americans with his play yuri and malcolm about the friendship between japanese american civil rights activist yuri kochiyama and civil rights icon and black nationalist leader malcolm when he learned from friend about little tokyo bronzeville period he felt it provided wonderful subject for play coincidentally at around the same time aaron woolfolk helped to paint the little tokyo mural as volunteer activity with his japan exchange and teaching programme alumni group the jet alumni association of southern california curious about an image on the mural depicting jazz legend charlie parker woolfolk was told about the neighborhood bronzeville period and how parker had been one of its residents woolfolk wrote down the basic information with plans to someday explore writing screenplay on the subject in 2007 toyama approached robey theatre company artistic director ben guillory and told him he wanted to do play about little tokyo bronzeville period in way that intertwined the japanese american and african american experiences guillory was enthusiastic about the idea and said he would like to see such play as robey theatre company production toyama said he felt he needed to create develop and write the play with an african american writer and asked guillory if he could recommend anyone guillory told him he had the ideal person in mind woolfolk who at the time was developing his feature film the harimaya bridge about an african american man in japan with guillory cast in the lead role guillory introduced toyama and woolfolk and they agreed to move forward on the project together over the next two years toyama and woolfolk came up with the plot and characters developed the story and wrote the play under guillory tutelage both writers drew heavily on their personal experiences when creating the plot and characters toyama was inspired by friend who had known of an instance in which an african american family had hidden japanese american man during internment in the 1940s he also called on his upbringing and experiences as member of the japanese american community including having several close relatives and friends who were in internment camps woolfolk drew on his lifelong friendships with japanese americans his experiences living and working in japan family stories of black migration from the deep south to california in the 1940s the murder of japanese friend in new york city and his subsequent visit to see her parents in japan longtime interest in the montford point marines and his love of jazz music toyama and woolfolk also did lot of research viewing old documents from the era and interviewing experts on little tokyo and its bronzeville period some of the robey theatre company early marketing materials erroneously stated that the play was based on true story this resulted from misunderstanding as the plot situations and characters were entirely created by woolfolk and toyama in 2008 toyama entered the play into the east west players david henry hwang writer institute under which he and woolfolk further developed the play and where it was performed for the first time in staged reading bronzeville premiered on april 17 2009 as robey theatre company production at the los angeles theatre center it enjoyed sold out run and was extended by two weeks reception bronzeville received rave reviews with toyama and woolfolk getting praise for the story characterizations and dialogue and guillory drawing raves for his innovative staging the cast was also heralded for its performances upon its premiere the play made the los angeles times critics choice list the 2013 revival also garnered strong critical notices the la stage times called it revelation and described it as having fine grained consistency that packs powerful punch awards recognition woolfolk and toyama were nominated for an ovation award in the category best playwrighting for an original play bronzeville was also nominated for four naacp theater awards toyama and woolfolk for best playwright guillory for best director the cast for best

1960s when as result of the introduction of amphibious vehicles it was essential to provide diving capability to the safety organization for the swimming of the vehicles amphibious operations also required better capability for the underwater reconnaissance of crossing sites following trials in 1966 diving sections were established in engineer units in 1969 once the diving capability was established additional tasks were added to make combat diving an extension of combat engineering into the water other tasks such as obstacle construction and breaching employing and detecting landmines and limited underwater construction were added to the safety standby and reconnaissance tasks general description combat divers provide the army with the capability of performing combat engineer tasks underwater they generally conduct tasks as part of the combined arms team however if required they have the ability to execute tasks independently combat divers are combat engineers who perform combat diving as secondary duty they are grouped into mission specific teams when task is identified and ordered to support operations niche area combat divers do the majority of their work on inland waterways either on the surface or beneath the water with breathing apparatus they usually work close to shorelines and riverbanks because that is where the rest of the army will be conducting operations at times the combat divers will work in salt water to support army operations in some circumstances combat divers can be used to conduct reconnaissance in the face of enemy forces they would be doing this reconnaissance with the support of the manoeuvre forces which could assist the dive team with observation and suppressive fire canada combat divers are an occupation sub specialization oss in its army combat engineer regiments training each of the four dive teams one located in each of the canadian army engineer regiments conducts an intense preliminary selection course typically two weeks in length to select combat diver candidates for training successful candidates then proceed to fleet diving unit to begin initial dive training and then proceed to the army dive center at the combat training center to complete the remainder of combat diver training once this training is completed combat divers must dive at least once every ninety days in order to
