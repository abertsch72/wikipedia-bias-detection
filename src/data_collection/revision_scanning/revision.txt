Sparks season|Roster}}\n\n== Controversies ==\nAfter both Game 4 and Game 5 of the WNBA Finals, the league acknowledged that they had made officiating mistakes late in the games that might have affected their final outcomes. Regarding Game 5, the league released this statement: "After reviewing postgame video, we have determined that Nneka Ogwumike\'s shot with 1:14 remaining in regulation time should not have counted due to a shot clock violation, and that the referees improperly failed to review the play under the instant replay rules." A similar statement was released after Game 4 after the league admitted to have blown an eight-second violation call.  Nevertheless, the outcomes of the games remained the same, with Minnesota taking game 4 and Los Angeles taking game 5.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.wnba.com/news/wnba-playoffs-2016-schedule/ Finals schedule] at WNBA.com\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{WNBA Finals}}\n{{2016 WNBA season by team}}\n{{Los Angeles Sparks}}\n{{Los Angeles Sparks 2016 WNBA Champions}}\n{{Minnesota Lynx}}\n{{NBA on ABC}}\n\n[[Category:Women\'s National Basketball Association Finals]]\n[[Category:2016 WNBA season|Finals]]\n[[Category:Los Angeles Sparks]]\n[[Category:Minnesota Lynx]]\n[[Category:October 2016 sports events in the United States|WNBA Finals]]\n[[Category:2016 in sports in Minnesota]]\n[[Category:2016 in sports in California]]\n[[Category:Sports competitions in Minneapolis]]\n[[Category:Sports competitions in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:2016 in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:2010s in Minneapolis]]', 'contentmodel': 'wikitext'}
